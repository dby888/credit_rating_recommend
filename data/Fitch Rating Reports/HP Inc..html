<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-14 April 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b>.</span>'s new unsecured issuances. The company will use the offering's net proceeds for general corporate purposes which may include refinancing of debt, including the $1.15 billion of unsecured notes maturing June 17, 2025, at maturity. The transaction is near leverage neutral with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast 2025 EBITDA leverage unchanged at 2.1x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mature Segments with Strong FCF: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s Print segment generates about one-third of revenues and has a mature profile with some revenue growth fluctuations that exceed economic trends. Longer term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates flat to modest annual contractions within this segment, with sustained above-GDP growth requiring M&A. Growth potential in the segment is challenged, but its higher relative operating margin results in strong contributions to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s Personal Systems, where <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a top three global position, provides stable revenues with upside from secular trends such as increased artificial intelligence requirements and video conferencing from hybrid work environment trends. An aging install base and Windows refresh cycle that has been delayed to date compared to previous cycles, as well as <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s inventory investments in 1Q25, should benefit 2H25 FCF. Within these segments, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s scale and market penetration has also positioned it to take advantage of several opportunities with growth and margin prospects above its core portfolio, such as AI PCs and Hybrid Systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Leverage Headroom: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s EBITDA leverage for fiscal year end (Oct. 31, 2024) was 2.1x, roughly in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s previously forecast 2.0x and downgrade sensitivity of 2.0x. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts fiscal 2025 EBITDA leverage to be at 2.1x with <span class="companylink">HP</span> maintaining leverage at the 2.0x downgrade sensitivity thorough the remainder of the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has not taken a rating action as the agency does not forecast EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 2x. <span class="companylink">HP</span> also has a track record of maintaining a conservative capital structure and FCF generation, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts after common dividends to be more than $2 billion annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capacity to Maintain Leverage: <span class="companylink">HP</span> aims for gross leverage of 1.5x-2.0x and has a track record of allocating FCF to discretionary debt repayments to maintain this range. One difference in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA leverage calculation versus <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s gross leverage calculation is that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> attributes factored receivables to gross debt, while <span class="companylink">HP</span> does not. This can lead to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated EBITDA leverage modestly exceeding 2.0x, with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s gross leverage remaining at the top end of its 1.5x-2.0x target. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s capacity and willingness to continue gross debt reductions that support below 2.0x gross leverage is an important credit profile consideration in the 'BBB+' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Emphasis on Capital Returns: Net of discretionary debt repayments, <span class="companylink">HP</span> aims to distribute 100% of FCF to shareholders using dividends, which roughly increase with earnings growth and share buybacks. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s flexibility and willingness to moderate share buyback levels when required to support debt repayments helps support its current credit profile. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has maintained a cash balance that more than adequately supports standard cyclicality in its business despite returning 100% of FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Capital Spending Benefits FCF: The Personal Systems and Printing segments generated operating margins of about 6% and 19%, respectively, supporting overall EBITDA margins of approximately 10%. Cost increases from possible additional tariffs may pressure margins, but with over 90% of North American products manufactured outside of China and some supply chain agility, <span class="companylink">HP</span> has capacity to mitigate the cost pressures. In addition, a low and stable capital cost structure consistently between 1% and 2% of revenues benefits <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ability to efficiently convert EBITDA to FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Dell Technologies, Inc.</span>'s (BBB/F2/Positive) relative business profile benefits from its exposure to the server and storage market. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business, which is reflected in EBITDA margins (both about 10%). <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile has historically remained stronger than <span class="companylink">Dell</span>'s, with higher FCF margins and a historically more conservative financial structure. However, in recent years <span class="companylink">Dell</span> has shrunk the financial structure differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial structure has traditionally been more conservative than <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span>'s (HPE; BBB+/F2/Stable). However, it has been more exposed to secular challenges, such as within its printing business. Inclusive of current and expected financing related to <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s Juniper acquisition, <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s core EBITDA is expected to increase approximately 1x above HP's, if the acquisition closes. However, this increase is expected to normalize over a period of deleveraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a larger shareholder return policy than <span class="companylink">Dell</span> or <span class="companylink">HPE</span>, which returns about 100% of FCF to shareholders compared to 80%+ FCF at <span class="companylink">Dell</span> and 60% at <span class="companylink">HPE</span>. The differences in return policy are partially explained by <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s practice of considering M&A a core component of its expected growth. <span class="companylink">Dell</span> focuses on smaller, more strategic value tuck-in acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s' return policy of 100% of FCF is consistent with many highly rated issuers, and the company has significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is a constraint on the rating, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target as supportive of its credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--In 2025, commercial performance in Personal Systems, supported by the Windows refresh cycle, more than offsets caution among consumers, resulting in mid-single-digit revenue growth in the segment. Longer-term growth is modestly above GDP, supported by higher prices and the increasing sales mix contribution from AI PCs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Print segment declines modestly in fiscal 2025. Longer term yoy growth is directionally flat to down, with competitive pricing pressures expected to persist in the segment;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">HP</span> maintains EBITDA margins above 10% during the forecast period supported by cost rationalization initiatives, strong print margins with a customer lifetime profitability focus and upside constrained by supply chain cost pressures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accounts receivable factoring levels stable during the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex is 1.25% revenue, in line with the historical low capital expense model and the expectation of no large capital buildouts during the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No material M&A during forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Maturing debt refinanced at similar levels with small discretionary debt repayments made as applicable from FCF to maintain gross leverage at <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s 1.5x-2.0x target. Remaining FCF after common dividends distributed to shareholders in buybacks;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual interest rates applicable to variable rate debt obligations decline from 4.2% to 3.5% before generally leveling out, reflecting the current SOFR forward curve. No revolver draws expected during the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shift toward aggressive financial policies or abandonment of leverage target;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accelerating declines in underlying PC or printing markets or loss of market position;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage expected to be sustained above 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--CFO-capex/debt sustained below 20%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material M&A without the expectation of returning to target leverage within 18-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A clear shift to a higher long-term organic revenue growth trends;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained below 1.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Structural improvement in EBITDA margins relative to peers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At end-fiscal 1Q25, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s liquidity position was supported by $2.9 billion cash and equivalents and an undrawn $5 billion sustainability-linked senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing August 2029 that backstops <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s $6 billion CP program. Additional liquidity is supported by $0.9 billion of uncommitted credit lines and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation of over $2 billion in annual FCF after dividends during the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s maturity structure is reasonably balanced over the next 10 years, with one $1.2 billion bond maturing beyond that in 2041.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b>.</span> is a leading global provider of personal computers, printers and supplies, as well as related solutions and services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-27 March 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b>.</span>'s Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB+' and 'F2', respectively. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB+' and Short-Term commercial paper (CP) ratings at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ratings reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations that the company will continue to operate within its target 1.5x-2.0x gross leverage financial policy target and take proactive measures to reduce gross debt when needed. The rating reflects <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s consistent FCF generation, which continues to benefit from its scale and market penetration despite a mature revenue profile in its Print segment and recent demand softness in its Personal Systems segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mature Segments with Strong FCF: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s Print segment generates about one-third of revenues and has a mature profile with some revenue growth fluctuations that exceed economic trends. Longer term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates flat to modest annual contractions within this segment, with sustained above-GDP growth requiring M&A. Growth potential in the segment is challenged, but its higher relative operating margin results in strong contributions to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s Personal Systems, where <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a top three global position, provides stable revenues with upside from secular trends such as increased artificial intelligence requirements and video conferencing from hybrid work environment trends. An aging install base and Windows refresh cycle that has been delayed to date compared to previous cycles, as well as <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s inventory investments in 1Q25, should benefit 2H25 FCF. Within these segments, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s scale and market penetration has also positioned it to take advantage of several opportunities with growth and margin prospects above its core portfolio, such as AI PCs and Hybrid Systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Leverage Headroom: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s EBITDA leverage for fiscal year end (Oct. 31, 2024) was 2.1x, roughly in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s previously forecast 2.0x and downgrade sensitivity of 2.0x. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts fiscal 2025 EBITDA leverage to be at 2.1x with <span class="companylink">HP</span> maintaining leverage at the 2.0x downgrade sensitivity thorough the remainder of the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has not taken a rating action as the agency does not forecast EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 2x. <span class="companylink">HP</span> also has a track record of maintaining a conservative capital structure and FCF generation, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts after common dividends to be more than $2 billion annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capacity to Maintain Leverage: <span class="companylink">HP</span> aims for gross leverage of 1.5x-2.0x and has a track record of allocating FCF to discretionary debt repayments to maintain this range. One difference in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA leverage calculation versus <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s gross leverage calculation is that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> attributes factored receivables to gross debt, while <span class="companylink">HP</span> does not. This can lead to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated EBITDA leverage modestly exceeding 2.0x, with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s gross leverage remaining at the top end of its 1.5x-2.0x target. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s capacity and willingness to continue gross debt reductions that support below 2.0x gross leverage is an important credit profile consideration in the 'BBB+' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Emphasis on Capital Returns: Net of discretionary debt repayments, <span class="companylink">HP</span> aims to distribute 100% of FCF to shareholders using dividends, which roughly increase with earnings growth and share buybacks. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s flexibility and willingness to moderate share buyback levels when required to support debt repayments helps support its current credit profile. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has maintained a cash balance that more than adequately supports standard cyclicality in its business despite returning 100% of FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Capital Spending Benefits FCF: The Personal Systems and Printing segments generated operating margins of about 6% and 19%, respectively, supporting overall EBITDA margins of approximately 10%. Cost increases from possible additional tariffs may pressure margins, but with over 90% of North American products manufactured outside of China and some supply chain agility, <span class="companylink">HP</span> has capacity to mitigate the cost pressures. In addition, a low and stable capital cost structure consistently between 1% and 2% of revenues benefits <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ability to efficiently convert EBITDA to FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Dell Technologies, Inc.</span>'s (BBB/F2/Positive) relative business profile benefits from its exposure to the server and storage market. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business, which is reflected in EBITDA margins (both about 10%). <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile has historically remained stronger than <span class="companylink">Dell</span>'s, with higher FCF margins and a historically more conservative financial structure. However, in recent years <span class="companylink">Dell</span> has shrunk the financial structure differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial structure has traditionally been more conservative than <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span>'s (HPE; BBB+/F2/Stable). However, it has been more exposed to secular challenges, such as within its printing business. Inclusive of current and expected financing related to <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s Juniper acquisition, <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s core EBITDA is expected to increase approximately 1x above HP's, if the acquisition closes. However, this increase is expected to normalize over a period of deleveraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a larger shareholder return policy than <span class="companylink">Dell</span> or <span class="companylink">HPE</span>, which returns about 100% of FCF to shareholders compared to 80%+ FCF at <span class="companylink">Dell</span> and 60% at <span class="companylink">HPE</span>. The differences in return policy are partially explained by <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s practice of considering M&A a core component of its expected growth. <span class="companylink">Dell</span> focuses on smaller, more strategic value tuck-in acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s' return policy of 100% of FCF is consistent with many highly rated issuers, and the company has significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is a constraint on the rating, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target as supportive of its credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--In 2025, commercial performance in Personal Systems, supported by the Windows refresh cycle, more than offsets caution among consumers, resulting in mid-single-digit revenue growth in the segment. Longer-term growth is modestly above GDP, supported by higher prices and the increasing sales mix contribution from AI PCs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Print segment declines modestly in fiscal 2025. Longer term yoy growth is directionally flat to down, with competitive pricing pressures expected to persist in the segment;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">HP</span> maintains EBITDA margins above 10% during the forecast period supported by cost rationalization initiatives, strong print margins with a customer lifetime profitability focus and upside constrained by supply chain cost pressures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accounts receivable factoring levels stable during the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex is 1.25% revenue, in line with the historical low capital expense model and the expectation of no large capital buildouts during the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No material M&A during forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Maturing debt refinanced at similar levels with small discretionary debt repayments made as applicable from FCF to maintain gross leverage at <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s 1.5x-2.0x target. Remaining FCF after common dividends distributed to shareholders in buybacks;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual interest rates applicable to variable rate debt obligations decline from 4.2% to 3.5% before generally leveling out, reflecting the current SOFR forward curve. No revolver draws expected during the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shift toward aggressive financial policies or abandonment of leverage target;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accelerating declines in underlying PC or printing markets or loss of market position;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage expected to be sustained above 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--CFO-capex/debt sustained below 20%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material M&A without the expectation of returning to target leverage within 18-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A clear shift to a higher long-term organic revenue growth trends;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained below 1.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Structural improvement in EBITDA margins relative to peers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At end-fiscal 1Q25, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s liquidity position was supported by $2.9 billion cash and equivalents and an undrawn $5 billion sustainability-linked senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing August 2029 that backstops <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s $6 billion CP program. Additional liquidity is supported by $0.9 billion of uncommitted credit lines and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation of over $2 billion in annual FCF after dividends during the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s maturity structure is reasonably balanced over the next 10 years, with one $1.2 billion bond maturing beyond that in 2041.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b>.</span> is a leading global provider of personal computers, printers and supplies, as well as related solutions and services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-04 April 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b>.</span>'s Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB+' and 'F2', respectively. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB+' and Short-Term CP ratings at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ratings reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations that <span class="companylink">HP</span> will continue to operate within <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s target 1.5x-2.0x gross leverage financial policy target, and take proactive measures to reduce gross debt when needed. The rating reflects <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s FCF generation consistency, which continues to benefit from its scale and market penetration despite a mature revenue profile in its Print Segment and recent demand softness in its Personal Systems segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mature Segments with Strong FCF: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s Printing segment, which generates approximately one-third of revenues, has a mature revenue profile with some revenue growth fluctuations that exceed economic trends. Longer term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates flat to modest contraction within this segment, with sustained above GDP growth requiring M&A. While growth potential in the segment is challenged, the segment's higher relative operating margin results in strong contributions from the segment to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP's Personal Systems provides stable revenues with upside from secular trends such as increased artificial intelligence requirements and video opportunities from hybrid work environment trends. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s commercial revenues to benefit over the longer term from the acquired Poly product suite and an improvements in enterprise spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Leverage Headroom: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s EBITDA leverage for fiscal year end (October 31) 2023 was 2.1x, slightly below <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s previously 2.2x forecast, but above <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s downgrade sensitivity of 2.0x. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts fiscal 2024 EBITDA leverage to be at 2.0x before <span class="companylink">HP</span> builds modest headroom through the remainder of the forecast. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has not taken a rating action given EBITDA leverage is not forecast to be sustained above 2x. Additionally, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s has a track record of maintaining a conservative capital structure and FCF generation, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts after common dividends, is in excess of $2 billion annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capacity to Maintain Leverage Target: <span class="companylink">HP</span> targets gross leverage in the 1.5x-2.0x range and has a track record of allocating FCF to discretionary debt repayments to maintain this range. One difference in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA leverage calculation versus <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s gross leverage calculation, is that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> attributes factored receivables to gross debt while <span class="companylink">HP</span> does not. This can lead to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> calculated EBITDA leverage modestly exceeding 2.0x, with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s gross leverage remaining within the top end of its 1.5x- 2.0x target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s believes <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s capacity and willingness to continue gross debt reductions that support below 2.0x gross leverage is an important credit profile consideration in the 'BBB+' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leveraging Scale in Growth Areas: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s scale and market penetration allows it to it to take advantage of a number of opportunities with growth and margin prospects above its core portfolio. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has identified these 'Key Growth Areas' and estimates they will grow to $15 billion of revenues by 2026. During fiscal 2023, these areas grew at mid-single digits compared to an overall revenue contraction of 14.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Emphasis on Capital Returns: Net of discretionary debt repayments, <span class="companylink">HP</span> aims to distribute 100% of FCF to shareholders using dividends, which roughly increase with earnings growth and share buybacks. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s flexibility and willingness to moderate share buyback levels when required to support debt repayments helps support its current credit profile. This was evidenced in fiscal 2023, when share buybacks decreased to $100 million from $4.3 billion in 2022 and <span class="companylink">HP</span> retired $1.6 billion of debt. Despite returning 100% of FCF, <span class="companylink">HP</span> has maintained a cash balance that more than adequately supports standard cyclicality in its business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Capital Spending Benefits FCF: Personal Systems and Printing segments generated operating margins of approximately 6% and 20%, respectively in fiscal 1Q24, resulting in an overall EBITDA margin of 10.7%. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s EBITDA margin should benefit from its three-year structural cost savings plan, which it originally announced in November 2022 and subsequently increased the goal from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. A low and stable capital cost structure, which is consistently between 1%-2% of revenues annually, benefits <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ability to efficiently convert EBITDA to FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared to <span class="companylink">Dell Technologies, Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Dell</span>'s industry profile rating sub-factor is two notches above HP at 'bbb-'. <span class="companylink">Dell</span>'s business profile benefits from its exposure to the server and storage market. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business, which is reflected in EBITDA margins (both at approximately 10%). <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile is stronger than <span class="companylink">Dell</span>'s, with higher FCF margins and a historically more conservative financial structure. However, <span class="companylink">Dell</span> has in recent years shrunk the financial structure difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared to <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.</span> (<span class="companylink">HPE</span>; BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial structure has traditionally been more conservative. However, it has been more exposed to secular challenges, such as within its printing business. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has better CFO-capex/debt at 23% in its fiscal 2023, compared to 12.2% for <span class="companylink">HPE</span>. Similar to <span class="companylink">HP</span>, <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s leverage is expected to increase to above its 2.0x, depending on how <span class="companylink">HPE</span> replaces the commitments for the $14 billion in term-loan financing at close of its Juniper acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a larger shareholder return policy then <span class="companylink">Dell</span> or <span class="companylink">HPE</span>, with a plan to return approximately 100% of FCF to shareholders compared to 80%+ FCF at <span class="companylink">Dell</span> and 60% at <span class="companylink">HPE</span>. The differences in return policy are partially explained by <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s practice of considering M&A a core component of its expected growth. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Dell</span> is targeting smaller more strategic value tuck in acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s' return policy of 100% of FCF is consistent with many highly rated issuers, and the company has significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is a constraint on the rating, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target as supportive of its credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Personal Systems growth in fiscal 2024 yoy performance improves modestly in 2H24 supported by market share in commercial, growth in video market and a slightly less cautious consumer. Longer term growth modestly above GDP;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Print segment declines modestly in fiscal 2024, but improves over 1Q24 trend. Longer term yoy growth approximately flat with visibility support adoption of HP All-In subscription offsetting overall hardware volume pressure;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">HP</span> maintains EBITDA margins in excess of 10% during forecast period supported by cost rationalization initiatives and sustained strong print margins with customer lifetime profitability focus;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A/R securitization levels stable during forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex of 1.25% revenue, in line with historic low capital expense model and the expectation no large capital build outs during forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No material M&A during forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Discretionary debt repayments made as applicable from FCF to maintain gross leverage between <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s 1.5x-2.0x target. Remaining FCF after common dividends distributed to shareholder in buyback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A clear shift to a higher long-term organic revenue growth trend;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA Leverage sustained below 1.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Structural improvement in EBITDA margins relative to peers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shift toward aggressive financial policies or abandonment of leverage target;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accelerating declines in underlying PC or printing markets or loss of market position;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA Leverage expected to be sustained above 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--CFO-Capex/debt sustained below 20%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material M&A without the expectation of return to target leverage within 18-24 months;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Multiple Liquidity Sources: At fiscal 1Q24, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s liquidity position was supported by $2.4 billion cash and equivalents, an undrawn $5 billion sustainability-linked senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing May 26, 2026 that back-stops HP's $6 billion commercial paper program. Further liquidity is supported by $1.2 billion of uncommitted credit lines and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation of over $2 billion after dividend annual FCF during the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s maturity structure is reasonably balanced over the next 10 years, with one $1.2 billion bond maturing beyond that in 2041.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b>.</span> is a leading global provider of personal computers, printers and supplies, as well as related solutions and services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-02 May 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>HP, Inc</b></span>.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB+' and Short-Term IDR and CP rating at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for solid financial flexibility and a conservative financial structure despite macroeconomic headwinds and excess inventory through the supply chain. Revenue will be lower even after adjusting for the addition of <span class="companylink">Polycom, Inc</span>. but <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s cost structure reduction initiatives should sustain profit margins near current levels and drive still meaningful annual FCF that will support targeted debt reductions, if necessary, and capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Restructuring Driven Profit Stabilization: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s "Future Ready" transformation plan announced November 2022, which aims to add $1.4 billion to profitability over the medium-run and includes meaningful headcount reductions of 4,000-6,000, will stabilize profitability despite considerable near-term revenue headwinds. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates EBITDA margins will remain in the low-double digits in the rating case even as revenue will be down by the mid-teens. The program also includes various portfolio review initiatives targeting <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s long-term profitable growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Conservative Financial Structure: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial structure will remain solid through the forecast period. <span class="companylink">HP</span> continues to publicly reiterate their commitment to a conservative capital structure, targeting EBITDA leverage in the 1.5x-2.0x range, below the company's 'BBB+' peer set. EBITDA leverage was slightly elevated for fiscal 2022 due to the acquisition of <span class="companylink">Polycom, Inc</span>. but will be returned to below 2.0x in the current year despite significant revenue declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Financial Flexibility: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s liquidity is also solid and supported by $1.5 billion-$2.5 billion of annual FCF and more than $2 billion of available cash and cash equivalents. The company has minimal aggregate debt maturities through the forecast period, which <span class="companylink">HP</span> can easily manage with FCF. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s profit margins will remain near recent peak levels despite lower revenue growth, driven by the company's cost structure reduction initiatives and improving sales mix. As a result, coverage ratios remain solid for the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Emphasis on Capital Returns: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates <span class="companylink">HP</span> will continue to prioritize FCF for capital returns with the publicly articulated caveat that FCF will be used for debt reduction if the company is likely to be above the upper end of its 2.0x EBITDA leverage target or to support acquisitions. As a result, the company moderated share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span> could limit stock buybacks to well below FCF in fiscal 2023, given macroeconomic conditions. Despite <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s repurchase of $4 billion of stock in fiscal 2022 as part of its value creation plan, cash remains in-line with the company's minimum target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisition Risk: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes secular pressure in printing markets may prompt <span class="companylink">HP</span> to pursue industry consolidating acquisitions or targets in adjacent markets similar to last year's Polycom deal. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span> would likely fund strategic acquisitions with some debt and could result in weaker credit metrics absent the company meaningfully curtailing capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ability to address secular challenges better than its comparably rated technology peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s organic growth, profitability and FCF prospects are greater than its closely related peers' and competitors', including <span class="companylink">Xerox</span> and <span class="companylink">Lexmark International Inc</span>., and comparable with 'BBB'-rated <span class="companylink">Dell Technologies, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> has improved its personal computer (PC) share in an overall market that has faced continued pressures, and achieved revenue growth reflecting its product mix as well as supply-chain scale despite component shortages. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has also maintained its leading market share in the aggregate global printer market. Its profitability metrics are high for the 'BBB' category, reflecting its margin profile and FCF, and the company is poised to expand its margins, owing to ongoing restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial structure is comparable with more highly rated corporates', and the company has significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is a constraint on the rating, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assigned the lower of two available short-term rating options based on the following observations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> determined the three-notch midpoint for <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial flexibility factor is 'a-', below the minimum required 'a' to achieve a higher short-term rating. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has comfortable liquidity, consistent with an 'a' factor rating and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span> would not have to use external funding in the next 12 months even under the very unlikely severe stress scenario whereby the company loses access to external funding. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial discipline factor at 'bbb', due to reduced headroom in its credit protection metrics, representing a potential weakness in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view and constraining the factor rating, as well as the short-term rating. <span class="companylink">HP</span> traditionally maintained a conservative financial policy in terms of leverage, although this is trending downward as the company pursues significant shareholder return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The financial structure factor is 'a-', consistent with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s leverage metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The operating environment factor (upper end of the rating band) is 'aa', given <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s geographic orientation is heavily weighted toward developed economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >No parent-subsidiary linkage is applicable, no Country Ceiling constraint was in effect for the ratings, and no operating environment influence was in effect. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> adds its estimate of receivables factoring to total debt and adjusts working capital and cash flow from financing accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-teens negative revenue growth in FY23 driven by the weak macroeconomic backdrop and excess inventory;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue will resume positive growth in FY24 from improved inventory with low-single digit revenue growth through the remainder of the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins remain just over 10% due to improved input prices and the impact of the company's cost structure reduction initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity at 1.25%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No material acquisitions or divestitures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">HP</span> manages debt levels to maintain EBITDA leverage at or below 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single-digit annual dividend growth and FCF allocated to stock buybacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained organic constant-currency revenue growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained below 1.5x through the cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt-to-FCF expected to be sustained at 3.5x or below through the cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further evidence of traction in growth and future initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Structural improvement in margins relative to those of peers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained revenue declines;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt-to-FCF sustained above 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accelerating declines in underlying PC or printing markets or increased competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material M&A without the expectation of return to target leverage within 18-24 months;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained shift toward aggressive financial policies or abandonment of leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s liquidity is solid and, as of Jan. 31, 2023, was supported by $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents ($1.8 billion of total cash and cash equivalents less $364 million of restricted cash) and an undrawn $5 billion sustainability-linked senior unsecured revolving credit facility due May 26, 2026, which back-stops the company's $6 billion CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for $3 billion-$4 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-06 June 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB+' ratings to <span class="companylink"><b>HP, Inc</b></span>.'s proposed senior notes offering. The proposed senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s existing senior unsecured indebtedness. The company plans to use net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to fund the acquisition of <span class="companylink">Plantronics, Inc</span>., which <span class="companylink">HP</span> remains on track to close by the end of calendar 2022, repaying <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span>' existing term loan, and pay any related fees and expenses. Remaining proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Plantronics Acquisition: The acquisition of <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> adds leading positions in video-conferencing solutions, peripherals and software to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ecosystem of devices, software and digital services for workforce management across customers' hybrid IT environments. <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> also adds $1.7 billion of annual revenue with accretive profit margins immediately upon close and $500 million of expected revenue synergies by fiscal year 2025 by leveraging <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s go-to-market and installed base. <span class="companylink">HP</span> also anticipates 600bp of operating profit margin expansion by FY25 from scale efficiencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On March 28, 2022, <span class="companylink">HP</span> announced it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span>, which specializes in video and audio equipment, for a purchase price of $1.7 billion, with a total transaction value of $3.3 billion, including <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span>' existing net debt. <span class="companylink">HP</span> expects the deal is expected to close by the end of 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sound Leverage & FCF Profile: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s credit protection metrics remain solid for the rating despite the uptick in leverage metrics as the result of the <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> acquisition. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA (inclusive of debt attributable to trade receivable sales) was below <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 1.5x positive rating sensitivity for the latest 12 months ended April 30, 2022, but should be closer to 1.8x on a pro-forma basis. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s free cash flow (FCF) margin will exceed 5% of revenue through the four-year forecast period, after normalizing for integration costs, providing ample financial flexibility for operational shortfalls, bolt-on acquisitions and capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unchanged Financial Policy: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">HP</span> to remain committed to maintaining its solid investment-grade rating while simultaneously continuing to invest in growth and return significant capital to shareholders. More recently, credit metrics have been strong for the rating, in part due to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s much better-than-expected operating results. Still, <span class="companylink">HP</span> will complete its "value creation plan" by returning at least $4 billion of capital to shareholders in FY22, which exceeds <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast FCF, and the acquisition will return credit metrics toward the higher end of <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s targeted ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Long-term Consolidation Prospects: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> continues to believe secular pressure in the print sector may warrant meaningful industry consolidation, which would likely result in debt funded acquisitions and, therefore, higher leverage and weaker credit protection metrics absent the company meaningfully curtailing capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ability to address secular challenges better than its comparably rated technology peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s organic growth, profitability and FCF prospects are greater than its closely related peers' and competitors', including <span class="companylink">Xerox</span> and <span class="companylink">Lexmark International Inc</span>., and comparable with 'BBB'-rated <span class="companylink">Dell Technologies, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> has improved its PC share in an overall market that has faced continued pressures, and achieved revenue growth reflecting its product mix as well as supply-chain scale despite component shortages. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has also maintained its leading market share in the aggregate global printer market. Its profitability metrics are high for the 'BBB' category, reflecting its margin profile and FCF, and the company is poised to expand its margins, owing to ongoing restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial structure is comparable with more highly rated corporates', and the company has significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is a constraint on the rating, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assigned the lower of two available short-term rating options based on the following observations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> determined the three-notch midpoint for <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial flexibility factor is 'a-', below the minimum required 'a' to achieve a higher short-term rating. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has very comfortable liquidity, consistent with an 'a' factor rating and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span> would not have to use external funding in the next 12 months even under the very unlikely severe stress scenario whereby the company loses access to external funding. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial discipline factor at 'bbb', due to reduced headroom in its credit protection metrics, representing a potential weakness in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view and constraining the factor rating, as well as the short-term rating. <span class="companylink">HP</span> traditionally maintained a conservative financial policy in terms of leverage, although this is trending downward as the company pursues significant shareholder return;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The financial structure factor is 'a', consistent with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s leverage metrics;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The operating environment factor (upper end of the rating band) is 'aa', given <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s geographic orientation is heavily weighted toward developed economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >No parent-subsidiary linkage is applicable, no Country Ceiling constraint was in effect for the ratings, and no operating environment influence was in effect. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> adds its estimate of receivables factoring to total debt and adjusts working capital and cash flow from financing accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low-single-digit revenue growth in FY22 and flat- to low-single-digit organic revenue growth over the remainder of rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">HP</span> closes <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> acquisition in fiscal 2023, adding $1.7 billion of faster-growing revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP operating margin in the 9%-10% range through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--At least $4 billion of share repurchases in FY22 and roughly equal to annual FCF after bolt-on acquisitions thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Maturities refinanced opportunistically, with short-term borrowings and estimated factoring debt held roughly constant over the forecast horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No incremental M&A, although <span class="companylink">HP</span> retains strategic flexibility to pursue transactions through reallocation of capital earmarked for share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained organic constant-currency revenue growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA expected to be sustained below 1.5x through the cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt-to-FCF expected to be sustained at 3.5x or below through the cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further evidence of traction in growth and future initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Structural improvement in margins relative to peers';</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained revenue declines;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA expected to be sustained above 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt-to-FCF sustained above 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accelerating declines in underlying PC or printing markets or increased competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material M&A without the expectation of return to target leverage within 18-24 months;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained shift toward aggressive financial policies or abandonment of leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s liquidity is solid and, as of April 30, 2022, was supported by $4.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $5 billion sustainability-linked senior unsecured revolving credit facility due 2026, which back-stops the company's $6 billion commercial paper program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for $3 billion-$4 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> is a leading provider of PCs and peripherals (roughly 70% of revenue and 45% of operating profit with mid-to-high single-digit margins) and printers and supplies (roughly 30% of revenue and 55% of operating profit with margins in the mid-teens.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-29 March 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>HP, Inc</b></span>.'s ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings, on the company's announcement that it will acquire Plantronics, Inc. Fitch has also assigned 'BBB+' ratings to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s proposed senior unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s affirmation affects $12.1 billion of total debt, including its undrawn revolving credit facility but excluding the proposed notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The acquisition of <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> adds leading positions in video-conferencing solutions, peripherals and software to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ecosystem of devices, software and digital services for workforce management across customers' hybrid IT environments. <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> also adds $1.7 billion of trailing 12-month revenue with accretive profit margins immediately upon close and $500 million of expected revenue synergies by fiscal year 2025 by leveraging <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s go-to-market and installed base. <span class="companylink">HP</span> also anticipates 600bp of operating profit margin expansion by FY25 from scale efficiencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> will acquire <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> in an all-cash transaction for approximately $3.3 billion, including <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span>' net debt, which was approximately $1.3 billion as of January 1, 2022. <span class="companylink">HP</span> expects the transaction to close by end-2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and approval by <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span>' stockholders. <span class="companylink">HP</span> will fund the transaction with available cash and debt, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates total debt will be 1.8x operating EBITDA, pro forma for the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The proposed senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s existing senior unsecured indebtedness and net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, re-financing of its 2022 maturities, working capital, a portion of the acquisition and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisition Boosts Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the acquisition of <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> will strengthen <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s growth profile, even before revenue synergies, given meaningful anticipated underlying market growth as businesses invest in optimizing their hybrid IT environments. <span class="companylink">HP</span> estimates the peripherals markets in which <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> participates at $110 billion with a high single-digit average growth, while the workforce solutions segment is estimated at $120 billion, growing slightly more slowly but also by the high single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sound Leverage & FCF Profile: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s credit protection metrics remain solid for the rating despite the uptick in leverage metrics as the result of the <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> acquisition. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s total debt with equity credit-to- operating EBITDA (inclusive of debt attributable to trade receivable sales) was below <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 1.5x positive rating sensitivity at end-January 2022 but should be closer to 1.8x on a pro-forma basis. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s free cash flow (FCF) margin will exceed 5% of revenue through the four-year forecast period, after normalizing for integration costs, providing ample financial flexibility for operational shortfalls, bolt-on acquisitions and capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unchanged Financial Policy: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">HP</span> to remain committed to maintaining its solid investment-grade rating while simultaneously continuing to invest in growth and return significant capital to shareholders. More recently, credit metrics have been strong for the rating, in part due to <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s much better-than-expected operating results. Still, <span class="companylink">HP</span> will complete its "value creation plan" by returning at least $4 billion of capital to shareholders in FY22, which exceeds <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast FCF, and the acquisition will return credit metrics toward the higher end of <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s targeted ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher Leverage Likely: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> continues to believe secular pressure in the print sector may warrant further industry consolidation, which would likely result in higher leverage and credit protection metrics being outside its stated leverage target unless <span class="companylink">HP</span> meaningfully curtails its capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s ability to address secular challenges better than its comparably rated technology peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s organic growth, profitability and FCF prospects are greater than its most closely related peers' and competitors', including <span class="companylink">Xerox</span>, <span class="companylink">Dell Technologies Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lexmark International Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> has improved its PC share in an overall market that has faced continued pressures, and achieved revenue growth reflecting its product mix as well as supply-chain scale despite component shortages. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has also maintained its leading market share in the aggregate global printer market. Its profitability metrics are high for the 'BBB' category, reflecting its margin profile and FCF, and the company is poised to expand its margins, owing to ongoing restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial structure is comparable with more highly rated corporates', and the company has significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is a constraint on the rating, we view <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assigned the lower of two available short-term rating options based on the following observations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> determined the three-notch midpoint for <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial flexibility factor is 'a-', below the minimum required 'a' to achieve a higher short-term rating. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has very comfortable liquidity, consistent with an 'a' factor rating and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">HP</span> would not have to use external funding in the next 12 months even under the very unlikely severe stress scenario whereby the company loses access to external funding. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial discipline factor at 'bbb', due to reduced headroom in its credit protection metrics, representing a potential weakness in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view and constraining the factor rating, as well as the short-term rating. <span class="companylink">HP</span> traditionally maintained a conservative financial policy in terms of leverage, although this is trending downward as the company pursues significant shareholder return;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The financial structure factor is 'a', consistent with <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s leverage metrics;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The operating environment factor (upper end of the rating band) is 'aa', given <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s geographic orientation is heavily weighted toward developed economies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >No parent-subsidiary linkage is applicable, no Country Ceiling constraint was in effect for the ratings, and no operating environment influence was in effect. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> adds its estimate of receivables factoring to total debt and adjusts working capital and cash flow from financing accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low- to mid- single-digit revenue growth in FY22, reflecting continued demand momentum with flat to low single-digit organic revenue growth over the remainder of rating horizon and <span class="companylink">Plantronics</span> adding $1.7 billion of faster-growing revenue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP operating margin in the 9%-10% range through the forecast period</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--At least $4 billion of share repurchases in FY22 and roughly equal to annual FCF after bolt-on acquisitions thereafter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Maturities refinanced opportunistically, with short-term borrowings and estimated factoring debt held roughly constant over the forecast horizon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No incremental M&A although <span class="companylink">HP</span> retains strategic flexibility to pursue transactions through reallocation of capital earmarked for share repurchases</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained organic constant-currency revenue growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA expected to be sustained below 1.5x through the cycle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt-to-FCF expected to be sustained at 3.5x or below through the cycle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further evidence of traction in growth and future initiatives</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Structural improvement in margins relative to peers'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained revenue declines</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA expected to be sustained above 2.0x</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt-to-FCF sustained above 4.5x</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accelerating declines in underlying PC or printing markets or increased competition</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material M&A without the expectation of return to target leverage within 18-24 months</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained shift toward aggressive financial policies or abandonment of leverage target</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s liquidity is solid and, as of January 31, 2022, was supported by $3.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $5 billion sustainability-linked senior unsecured revolving credit facility due 2026, which back-stops the company's $6 billion commercial paper program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for $3 billion-$4 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">HP</span> is a leading provider of PCs and peripherals (roughly 70% of revenue and 45% of operating profit with mid-to-high single-digit margins), as well as printers and supplies (roughly 30% of revenue and 55% of operating profit with margins in the mid-teens).</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-07 September 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed Peraton Holding Corp. (Peraton), Peraton Corp. and Peraton Inc.'s 'B' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs). Fitch has affirmed the company's first lien credit facility at 'BB-'/'RR2' and second lien loans at 'CCC+'/'RR6'. Fitch has also affirmed Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC's notes, which continue to benefit from an irrevocable guarantee for any principal and interest from <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>. (BBB+/Stable). The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The affirmation incorporates the announced incremental $240 million to be borrowed under the first lien facility to finance an acquisition in the federal IT infrastructure services space. Fitch views the transaction as relatively neutral to Peraton's credit profile, as an acquisition would further diversify the company's contracts and product offerings, while generating EBITDA and FCF to largely offset the incremental debt issued to fund the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peraton's ratings are supported by its strong and stable FCF generation, revenue visibility from multiyear contracts, advantages of scale, and high degree of technology content. These positive factors are somewhat offset by the company's pro forma leverage, which Fitch expects to be temporarily high for a 'B' rating. Execution and acquisition integration remain key watch items and will be necessary to meet or exceed Fitch's expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Leverage for Rating: Fitch forecasts Peraton's pro forma 2021 leverage (debt/EBITDA) will be around 7.0x, including standard cost synergies and initial debt paydown related to divestitures, high for the 'B' rating. The company's financial structure weighs heavily on its IDR, though Fitch expects Peraton will delever significantly over the next few years due to the expected 50% FCF sweep in its credit agreements, as well as management's stated intention to reduce the debt quantum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Risks to deleveraging include potential changes in either capital deployment strategy or management structure, increased competition, additional debt-funded M&A activity beyond a small bolt-on transaction, or unforeseen issues regarding integrating acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integration Risk: Fitch views Peraton's roll-up strategy as achievable, but it carries meaningful and inherent integration risk. The company is sharply increasing in scale through two major, transformative acquisitions during a very short period of time. It will need to execute effectively to delever inline with Fitch's projections and maintain a competitive position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profitability, Financial Flexibility: Peraton's profitability profile is strong for the 'B' rating and is more consistent with an investment-grade company. Fitch heavily weights the company's profitability when considering the overall rating and views it as a mitigant against its temporarily high leverage. Fitch forecasts the company will maintain consistent EBITDA margins in the mid double digits and generate average FCF margins in excess of 4%-5% over the rating horizon. This could support upward rating momentum over the next several years if the company uses its substantial financial flexibility to pay down debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nimble Structure: Peraton has an asset-light operating model with minimal capex and working capital requirements. In addition to supporting its high margins, this should allow Peraton to manage most potential downturns or disruptions well compared with similarly rated companies. The company's operating structure also supports the ability to execute on day-one cost synergies with each of the transformative acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Advanced Technology Supports Growth: Peraton is almost entirely a services-based company with highly technological offerings across the broad spectrum of IT services and cybersecurity. Key focus areas of the pro forma company include intelligence, space systems and protection, hypersonics, defensive cyber threat operations, C5ISR, homeland security and health services. Fitch believes these will align well with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Defense</span>'s top objectives over the foreseeable future, while increased spending on health services technology is also likely over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These factors support Fitch's expectation that the company will return mid-single-digit organic revenue growth on average through 2024. Broader pressure for <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> budget cuts in the wake of significant stimulus spending related to the coronavirus pandemic are possible, but the risk to Peraton is below industry average given its high degree of technology content and the increased importance of cybersecurity spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stability and Visibility: Fitch considers many of Peraton's offerings to be critical and less susceptible to economic downturns than many peers due to the higher-end capabilities that the company performs. Peraton does not have a material batch of contracts up for review in the next 1-2 years, which Fitch believes mitigates the risk of a potential near-term stress scenario of increased competition or contract loss. Peraton has overall contract renewal rates greater than 90%, with a low likelihood of material cancellations due to the importance of the services the company provides. The company's meaningful exposure to classified programs further reduces the risk of cancellations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Degree of Competition: Fitch considers competition to be moderate-to-high across the various industries Peraton operates. However, the company's diversification, management experience, and wide range of capabilities provides an advantage when bidding on projects and puts it in a solid position to win new business. Following the announced transactions, the company will become one of the largest independent government IT and services providers. This increased scale is generally more in line with higher-rated entities and could provide some advantage over smaller peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Experienced Management Team: Fitch views Peraton's management team as strong and well experienced to handle potential changes within the industry. Each of its top executives has more than 25 years of industry experience at current competitors and at the <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>'s legacy services business that will be acquired. Peraton president and CEO Stu Shea is the former president and COO of the company's largest independent competitor, Leidos, and was involved in the spin-off of one of the other top competitors in the industry, <span class="companylink">Science Applications International Corp</span>. This experience offers valuable insight and could provide a modest advantage, particularly in light of the announced M&A activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peraton's rating is principally derived through the balance of its high leverage for the rating level against steady and highly visible growth and profitability. Fitch considers each of these factors to be heavily weighted when forming the rating. Leverage is significantly higher than similarly rated companies, as well as like-sized and modestly larger peers such as Leidos and <span class="companylink">Science Applications International</span>, which Fitch expects would be rated multiple notches higher than Peraton. However, the company has higher EBITDA margins, similar cash flow margins and similar financial flexibility as its peers, despite the higher leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Full year pro forma results for all acquisitions are incorporated into December year-end 2021 despite staggered closing dates;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single digit organic revenue growth per year, supported by the company's high renewal rate, likely step-ups within certain contracts, and Peraton competing in high priority areas of government spending such as space, cybersecurity and C5ISR;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--NGEN contract results excluded from forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Company makes certain divestitures from legacy Perspecta related to systems engineering contracts; proceeds will be used predominantly to repay debt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-teen EBITDA margins throughout the forecasts; Peraton and the Northrop assets will likely generate margins in the low-teens, while Perspecta will likely generate margins in the high-teens before financing lease adjustments; new incremental acquisition generates significantly stronger EBITDA margins than the consolidated business;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Minimal working capital cash requirements and capex spending over the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess cash is generally deployed to debt paydown over the next few years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No material dividends to sponsor over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The recovery analysis assumes that Peraton would be considered a going concern in bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. A 10% administrative claim is assumed in the recovery analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assumes Peraton will receive a going-concern recovery multiple of 7.0x EBITDA under this scenario. Fitch considers this multiple to be towards the upper middle range of recovery multiples assigned to companies in the aerospace & defense sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's recovery assumptions are based on Peraton's pro forma capital structure for recent acquisitions. Fitch considered the company's strong cash flow generation, nimble operating structure, stable margins, revenue visibility, and strong product offerings. Fitch also took into account the company's contract diversification and key focus areas, which align well with long-term <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Defense</span> and broader <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> initiatives. Each of these factors supports a medium to high recovery multiple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assumes $860 million as the going concern EBITDA in the analysis. Fitch estimates the hypothetical bankruptcy emergence and GC EBITDA would be around 20% lower than 2021 pro forma EBITDA after finance lease adjustments. The assumption incorporates the proforma EBITDA of Peraton, Northrop Grumman's Federal IT and Mission Support Services business, <span class="companylink">Perspecta, Inc</span>., and an incremental acquisition in the federal IT infrastructure space, which is the main reason for the increase from the $840 million GC EBITDA used in previous analysis. Fitch views the company prospectively in its analysis and derive the going concern EBITDA under the assumption that the company were to enter bankruptcy more than a year after combination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A hypothetical bankruptcy could result from either reputational damage from poor execution or significant shift in industry dynamics or competition, which would each result in a material loss of revenue and deterioration of underlying operations. This decline would be similar to a scenario if the company were to lose nearly all of its recompete contracts one or two years following the combination. Most of the defaulters in the aerospace & defense sector observed by Fitch in recent bankruptcy case studies were significantly smaller in scale, had less diversified product lines or customer bases and were operating with highly leveraged capital structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch generally assumes a fully drawn first lien revolver in its recovery analyses since credit revolvers are tapped as companies are under distress. Fitch also assumes the second lien term loan holders would receive a 4% concession payment from the first lien debt holders under a bankruptcy scenario. This is supported by the significant portion of second lien debt, which is in excess of 25% of total debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 'BB-' rating and Recovery Rating of 'RR2' on the first lien debt is based on Fitch's recovery analysis under a going concern scenario, which indicates strong recovery prospects. The 'CCC+' rating and Recovery Rating of 'RR6' on the company's second lien term loan would indicate poor recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Perspecta Enterprise Solutions notes are excluded from the recovery waterfall due to the irrevocable guarantee for any principal and interest from <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>., which is rated 'BBB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Leverage (debt/EBITDA) sustained below 6.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Successful integration of the various large acquisitions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FFO Interest Coverage sustained above 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Leverage sustained above 7.0x beyond 12 months to 18 months post-transaction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FFO Interest Coverage sustained below 2.0x beyond 12 months to 18 months post-transaction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Company experiences significant unexpected cash costs related to the transaction that hinders liquidity position or cash flow;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material loss of major contracts;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Change in capital deployment strategy to fund significant shareholder actions instead of reducing leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch considers Peraton's pro forma liquidity profile to be adequate to support the company and expects the company will have an undrawn revolver at close of $500 million, in addition to an ample cash balance in excess of $150 million. Peraton should also generate significant FCF to support operations, as working capital and capex requirements are low. The company's debt structure is predominantly comprised of a first lien revolver maturing in 2026, first lien debt maturing in 2028, and second lien term loan maturing in 2029.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition to this structure, there is approximately $66 million in principal outstanding of legacy Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC's 7.45% notes due 2029. The notes bear a guarantee of any principal and interest by <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>. (BBB+) as successor to <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Company</span>, which provided an irrevocable guarantee in 2008 upon its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Electronic Data Systems, LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peraton Holding Corp. (Peraton) and its subsidiaries provide highly differentiated space, intelligence, cyber, defense, homeland security, and communications solutions, and is a partner on missions that are critical to the security priorities of the United States.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peraton has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Financial Transparency and disclosure risk due to the its private financials and intermittent reporting, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the ratings in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-07 June 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>.'s announced senior unsecured notes and sustainability notes. Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB+' rating to HP's new five-year sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, which HP entered into May 26. HP will use the net proceeds of the senior notes for general corporate purposes including redemption of all of the outstanding $412 million 4.375% notes and $586 million 4.650% notes due 2021. HP will use the net proceeds of the sustainability notes to finance or refinance projects that meet one or more eligibility criteria including renewable energy, green buildings, energy efficiency, clean transportation, pollution prevention, eco-efficient technologies, sustainable land use and socioeconomic advancement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" > The interest margin and commitment fee on the revolver depend on HP's senior unsecured debt rating with adjustments for meeting specified sustainability targets with respect to greenhouse gas reduction and diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Better than Expected Pandemic Performance: HP's business showed resilience during the coronavirus pandemic, buoyed by consumer demand for both personal systems (PS) and printing. Consumer PS revenue increased 42% in 3Q20, 24% in 4Q20, 34% in 1Q21 and 72% in 2Q21. Consumer print revenue increased 7%, 21%, 55% and 77% respectively, in the same periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Overall revenue for the LTM period ended Jan. 31, 2021 was down only 1.7% and nearly flat on a constant currency basis as a result. Fitch had expected revenue to decline high-single digits in 2H20 led by double digit declines in print. While historically viewed as a liability, HP's consumer segment provided an important offset to reduced office PS and printing demand. By contrast, Xerox revenue fell 23% in 2020. HP's prints segment declined 9% in the LTM period ended Jan. 31, 2021. Fitch now expects HP's consolidated revenue to grow in the low-double digits in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage & FCF Profile: Despite near-term operational challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic, HP has maintained strong credit protection metrics. HP's total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA (inclusive of debt attributable to trade receivable sales) was 1.4x at April 30, 2021, below Fitch's 1.5x positive rating sensitivity. Gross debt to FCF (post-dividend) was 1.9x, also below Fitch's 3.5x positive sensitivity. Fitch sees HP's gross leverage exiting FY21 at 1.6x while gross debt to FCF will be approximately 3.5x. Fitch expects HP's FCF margin will approach 5% of revenue in FY21 as working capital uses are offset by continued cost discipline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch further assumes that HP continues to return approximately $12 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in FY21 and FY22 via allocation of 100% of FCF and incremental borrowings of approximately $3 billion. Leverage under this scenario rises to 1.7x, leaving ample headroom to Fitch's sensitivities to accommodate weak operating performance. As a result, the agency sees HP's credit protection metrics and overall business profile remaining consistent with 'BBB+'. However, this view is uncertain and subject to the workplace and consumer demand patterns and HP's further ability to reduce it cost structure while maintaining its market position, although the company's resiliency through the coronavirus is highly encouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Policy: Given HP's better than expected operating performance we believe the company will not delay or downsize its Value Creation Plan. Previously, HP committed to prudently maintain leverage at the lower end of its 1.5x to 2.0x range (calculated excluding share-based compensation and debt attributable to trade receivable sales) during the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic impact. HP has underscored its flexibility to alter its plan while stressing its desire to maintain its credit rating. This is supported by its post-separation track record of fiscal conservatism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Gross leverage has largely remained below 2.0x since FY15 and only temporarily exceeding in conjunction with the company's acquisition of Samsung's printer business. Additionally, the company has shown discipline in resisting a transaction with Xerox both due to that company's operational performance and potential capital structure impacts. While HP's Value Plan continues to represent a more aggressive financial policy, its concurrent adoption of an explicit leverage target and willingness to maintain it in the face of operational challenges is consistent with its rating given operational uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Options: Fitch continues to believe secular pressure in the print sector may warrant further industry consolidation. While a combination with Xerox appears to be off the table at this time, HP's CEO said previously that he saw strategic merit in a combination with Xerox. However, Fitch no longer assumes the risk of a pro forma capital structure that would be leveraging and require HP to maintain credit protection metrics above its stated leverage target or abandon its shareholder plan, which previously weighed on HP's rating. Additionally, in Fitch's view this is also no longer offset by operational challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and its potential longer-term impacts, which have been less severe than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect HP's ability to manage through a temporary shock like the coronavirus pandemic and address secular headwinds to a greater degree than its comparably rated technology peers. Fitch believes HP's organic growth, profitability and FCF prospects are meaningfully greater than its most closely related peers and competitors, including <span class="companylink">Xerox Corporation</span>, Dell Technologies and <span class="companylink">Lexmark</span>. HP has improved its PC market share in an overall market that has faced continued pressures, and achieved revenue growth reflecting its product mix as well as supply chain scale amid component shortages. HP has also maintained its leading market share in the aggregate global printer market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP's profitability metrics are high for the 'BBB' category, reflecting its margin profile and FCF generation, and the company is poised to expand its margin owing to ongoing restructuring. HP's financial structure is comparable with more highly-rated corporates, and the company enjoys significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is limiting to the rating we view HP's financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assigned the lower of two available short-term rating options based on the following observations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch has determined the three-notch midpoint for HP's Financial Flexibility factor is 'a-', below the minimum required of 'a' to achieve a higher short-term rating. HP has very comfortable liquidity consistent with an 'a' factor rating (Fitch believes HP would not have to use external funding in the next 12 months even under the very unlikely event of a severe stress scenario whereby the company loses access to external funding). However, Fitch assesses HP's Financial Discipline factor to be 'bbb' since HP is shifting away from its historical practice of maintaining significant headroom in its credit protection metrics, representing a material weakness in Fitch's view, constraining the factor rating and thus the short-term rating. HP has traditionally maintained a conservative financial policy in terms of leverage although this appears to be trending downwards as the company pursues significant shareholder return;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Financial Structure factor is 'a', consistent with HP's leverage metrics;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Operating Environment factor (upper end of the rating band) is 'aa' given HP's geographic orientation heavily weighted towards developed economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >No parent/subsidiary linkage is applicable, no Country Ceiling constraint was in effect for these ratings, and no Operating Environment influence was in effect for these ratings. Fitch adds its estimate of receivables factoring to total debt and adjusts working capital and cash flow from financing accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low double-digit revenue increase in fiscal 2021 reflecting continued momentum in personal systems and print segments. Roughly flat to low single-digit revenue declines over the rating horizon from FYE 2021 levels;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP operating margin of 8% to 9% in fiscal 21 stabilizing at around 7% to 8% over the rating horizon, reflecting cost reduction efforts partially offsetting mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Return of greater than 100% of FCF to shareholders in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, while maintaining gross leverage (by HP's definition) within HP's 1.5x-2.0x range. Additional share repurchases financed through combination of balance sheet cash and incremental debt with total share repurchases of approximately $12 billion through FY22;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Maturities refinanced opportunistically, short-term borrowings and estimated factoring debt held roughly constant over the forecast horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No M&A assumed though HP retains strategic flexibility to pursue transactions through reallocation of capital earmarked for share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained organic constant currency revenue growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA expected to be sustained below 1.5x through the cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt to FCF expected to be sustained at 3.5x or below through the cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further evidence of traction in growth and future initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Structural improvement in margins relative to peers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained negative revenue growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA expected to be sustained above 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross debt to FCF sustained above 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Accelerating declines in underlying PC and/or printing markets or increased competition therein;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material M&A without the expectation of return to target leverage within 18-24 months;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained shift toward aggressive financial policies and/or abandonment of leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity and Debt Structure: HP's liquidity is supported by $3.4 billion total cash and cash equivalents at April 30, 2021. HP had access to its undrawn $4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which backs up its $6 billion CP program at April 30, 2021. Subsequent to quarter end, HP entered into a new five-year sustainability-linked $5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and terminated its $4 billion revolver and $1 billion 364-day facility. HP had no CP borrowings at April 30, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views HP's revolver availability, readily available cash, and FCF as fully backstopping HP's CP program. Fitch expects HP will generate around $2.8 billion in FCF (post-dividend) in FY21. Fitch expects HP's proposed issuance will be used to redeem the $412 million principal outstanding 4.375% notes due in September and $586 million principal outstanding 4.650% notes due in December. HP's maturities are well staggered thereafter. Fitch assumes HP will refinance maturities as they come due and will issue debt to fund share repurchases in excess of FCF while managing its capital structure to its leverage target.</p>

In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-11 May 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink">Perspecta Inc</span>.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'B' from 'BB' with a Stable Outlook, resolving the Rating Watch Negative, and withdrawn it and the 'BB+'/'RR1' senior first lien secured revolving credit facility and term loan ratings, which were terminated on May 6, 2021 in conjunction with the completion of its acquisition by Peraton Holding Corp. (B/Stable). Fitch has also affirmed Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC's notes, which continue to benefit from an irrevocable guarantee for any principal and interest from <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>., which is rated 'BBB+' (affirmed May 5, 2021 with a Stable Outlook).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch is withdrawing the ratings of <span class="companylink">Perspecta Inc</span>. as the company is undergoing a reorganization. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for Perspecta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As a result of the acquisition by Peraton, Perspecta will remain a separate legal entity, wholly owned by Peraton. Peraton's post-acquisition ratings are materially lower than Perspecta's prior stand-alone rating. Fitch assesses the linkage between Peraton and Perspecta as strong due to legal, operational and strategic ties. As a result, Fitch links Perspecta's ratings with those of Peraton's, which Fitch rated 'B' on Feb. 11, 2021. Perspecta is not expected to separately report financials and its credit agreement was terminated with the completion of its acquisition May 6, 2021. Therefore, Fitch has withdrawn Perspecta's IDR and associated debt ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Perspecta is an IT and mission services provider with similar scale and scope to former standalone competitor CSRA. However, Perspecta's relatively weaker prospective credit protection metrics at the time of its formation corresponded to a lower rating category. CSRA was acquired by <span class="companylink">General Dynamics Corporation</span>, which has substantially greater scale, business diversity, and financial resources. Perspecta's margin profile compares favorably with other <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> IT and mission services providers, including <span class="companylink">Science Applications International Corporation</span>, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation and CAIC, due to its favorable contract mix with a materially higher balance of fixed-price contracts. Perspecta is of smaller scale than Leidos, similar in size to SAIC, and Booz Allen, and larger than CAIC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Low single-digit revenue growth annually (excluding NGEN) over the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Low-teens operating EBITDA margins (burdened by finance lease interest and amortization) sustained over the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating sensitivities are no longer relevant given today's rating withdrawals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Perspecta had $224 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Jan. 1, 2021. The company's revolving credit facility was terminated May 6, 2021 along with its term loans. The $66 million in principal outstanding of legacy Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC's 7.45% notes due 2029 remain outstanding. The notes bear a guarantee of any principal and interest by <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>. (BBB+) as successor to <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Company</span>, which provided an irrevocable guarantee in 2008 upon its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Electronic Data Systems, LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-05 May 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>.'s Long-Term 'BBB+' and Short-Term 'F2' Issuer Default Rating and associated debt and CP ratings. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The affirmation and Outlook stabilization reflect that despite the impact of the coronavirus, which was less severe for HP than originally feared, the company is in a much better position to maintain its credit protection metrics generally consistent with Fitch's sensitivities while still returning $16 billion to shareholders. Fitch continues to see uncertainty over the longer-term impact of the coronavirus on HP's print business and has modelled lower revenue (about 10% below the roughly $20 to $21 billion achieved in FY18 and FY19). However, the company said it is tracking ahead of plan on its three-year $1.2 billion gross run rate cost reduction plan and it has seen significant uptake in its subscription businesses including HP+.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Better than Expected Pandemic Performance: HP's business showed resilience during the coronavirus buoyed by consumer demand for both personal systems (PS) and printing. Consumer PS revenue increased 42% in 3Q20, 24% in 4Q20 and 34% in 1Q21. Consumer print hardware revenue increased 7%, 21% and 55%, respectively, in the same periods. Overall revenue for the LTM period ended Jan. 31, 2021 was down only 1.7% and nearly flat on a constant currency basis as a result. Fitch had expected revenue to decline high-single digits in 2H20 led by double digit declines in print. While historically viewed as a liability, HP's consumer segment provided an important offset to reduced office PS and printing demand. By contrast, Xerox revenue fell 23% in 2020. HP's prints segment declined 9% in the LTM period ended Jan. 31, 2021. Fitch now expects HP's consolidated revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single digits in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage & FCF Profile: Despite near-term operational challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic, HP has maintained strong credit protection metrics. HP's total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA (inclusive of debt attributable to trade receivable sales) was 1.5x at Jan. 31, 2021, at Fitch's 1.5x positive rating sensitivity. Gross debt to FCF (post-dividend) was 3.4x, also below Fitch's 3.5x positive sensitivity. Fitch sees HP's gross leverage exiting FY21 at 1.6x while gross debt to FCF will be 3.5x. Fitch expects HP's FCF margin will approach 5% of revenue in FY21 as working capital uses are offset by continued cost discipline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch further assumes that HP continues to return approximately $12 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in FY21 and FY22 via allocation of 100% of FCF and incremental borrowings of approximately $3 billion. Leverage under this scenario rises to 1.7x, leaving ample headroom to Fitch's sensitivities to accommodate weak operating performance. As a result, the agency sees HP's credit protection metrics and overall business profile remaining consistent with 'BBB+'. However, this view is uncertain and subject to the workplace and consumer demand patterns and HP's further ability to reduce it cost structure while maintaining its market position, although the company's resiliency through the coronavirus is highly encouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Policy: Given HP's better than expected operating performance we believe the company will not delay or downsize its Value Creation Plan. Previously, HP committed to prudently maintain leverage at the lower end of its 1.5x to 2.0x range (calculated excluding share-based compensation and debt attributable to trade receivable sales) during the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic impact. HP has underscored its flexibility to alter its plan while stressing its desire to maintain its credit rating. This is supported by its post-separation track record of fiscal conservatism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Gross leverage has largely remained below 2.0x since FY15 and only temporarily exceeding in conjunction with the company's acquisition of Samsung's printer business. Additionally, the company has shown discipline in resisting a transaction with Xerox both due to that company's operational performance and potential capital structure impacts. While HP's Value Plan continues to represent a more aggressive financial policy, its concurrent adoption of an explicit leverage target and willingness to maintain it in the face of operational challenges is consistent its rating given operational uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Options: Fitch continues to believe secular pressure in the print sector may warrant further industry consolidation. While a combination with Xerox appears to be off the table at this time, HP's CEO said previously he saw strategic merit in a combination with Xerox. However, Fitch no longer assumes the risk of a pro forma capital structure that would be leveraging and require HP to maintain credit protection metrics above its stated leverage target or abandon its shareholder plan, which previously weighed on HP's rating. Additionally, in Fitch's view this is also no longer offset by operational challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and its potential longer-term impacts which now appear less severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect HP's ability to manage through a temporary shock like the coronavirus pandemic and address secular headwinds to a greater degree than its comparably rated technology peers. Fitch believes HP's organic growth, profitability and FCF prospects are meaningfully greater than its most closely related peers and competitors, including <span class="companylink">Xerox Corporation</span>, Dell Technologies and <span class="companylink">Lexmark</span>. HP has improved its PC market share in an overall market that has faced continued pressures, and achieved revenue growth reflecting its product mix as well as supply chain scale amid component shortages. HP has also maintained its leading market share in the aggregate global printer market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP's profitability metrics are high for the 'BBB' category, reflecting its margin profile and FCF generation, and the company is poised to expand its margin owing to ongoing restructuring. HP's financial structure is comparable with more highly-rated corporates, and the company enjoys significant financial flexibility. However, while the underlying sector trend is limiting to the rating we view HP's financial policy in the context of its explicit leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assigned the lower of two available short-term rating options based on the following observations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch has determined the three-notch midpoint for HP's Financial Flexibility factor is 'a-', below the minimum required of 'a' to achieve a higher short-term rating. HP has very comfortable liquidity consistent with an 'a' factor rating (Fitch believes HP would not have to use external funding in the next 12 months even under the very unlikely event of a severe stress scenario whereby the company loses access to external funding). However, Fitch assesses HP's Financial Discipline factor to be 'bbb' since HP is shifting away from its historical practice of maintaining significant headroom in its credit protection metrics, representing a material weakness in Fitch's view, constraining the factor rating and thus the short-term rating. HP has traditionally maintained a conservative financial policy in terms of leverage although this appears to be trending downwards as the company pursues significant shareholder return;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Financial Structure factor is 'a', consistent with HP's leverage metrics;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Operating Environment factor (upper end of the rating band) is 'aa' given HP's geographic orientation heavily weighted towards developed economies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >No parent/subsidiary linkage is applicable, no Country Ceiling constraint was in effect for these ratings, and no Operating Environment influence was in effect for these ratings. Fitch adds its estimate of receivables factoring to total debt and adjusts working capital and cash flow from financing accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity and Debt Structure: HP's liquidity is supported by $4.2 billion total cash and cash equivalents (approximately $3.8 billion in Fitch-defined readily available cash) at Jan. 31, 2021. While HP historically maintained efficient access to its cash held abroad, Fitch assumes nearly unfettered access in light of U.S. tax reform. HP has access to its undrawn $4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which backs up its $6 billion CP program. Additionally, on May 29, 2020, the company entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility with $1 billion in aggregate lending commitments. HP had no CP borrowings at Jan. 31, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views HP's revolver availability, readily available cash, and FCF as fully backstopping HP's CP program. Fitch expects HP will generate around $2.7 billion in FCF (post-dividend) in FY21. HP's maturities are well staggered the first being $412 million principal outstanding 4.375% notes due in September. Fitch assumes HP will refinance maturities as they come due and will issue debt to fund share repurchases in excess of FCF while managing its capital structure to its leverage target.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-28 January 2021: Fitch has placed <span class="companylink">Perspecta Inc</span>.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior secured 'BB+'/'RR1'ratings on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). Fitch has affirmed Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC's notes at 'BBB+' which continue to benefit from an irrevocable guarantee for any P&I from <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>., which is rated 'BBB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The action reflects the announcement by Perspecta that it entered into a definitive agreement under which it will be acquired by Peraton, a portfolio company of Veritas Capital, in an all-cash transaction valued at $7.1 billion. (On Dec. 7, 2020, the federal IT and mission support services businesses of <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span> entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Peraton for $3.4 billion.) The transaction, which has been approved by Perspecta's board of directors, is expected to close in 1H21, subject to shareholder approval, regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The RWN reflects Fitch's expectation that Peraton's post-acquisition ratings may be materially lower than Perspecta's current 'BB' IDR and, accordingly, could result in linkage of Perspecta's ratings with those of Peraton's. Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch within 12 months, pending further review of the transaction and financing plans, and if Fitch were to Downgrade Perspecta, the agency expects the Downgrade would likely be greater than one notch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Agency's Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low single-digit revenue growth annually (excluding NGEN) over the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low-teens operating EBITDA margins (burdened by finance lease interest and amortization) sustained over the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividend in line with current; no share repurchases pending transaction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No further discretionary debt repayment pending transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch does not anticipate positive rating action in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Completion of Perspecta's acquisition by Peraton may lead to a Downgrade of Perspecta's IDR and senior secured ratings. If the transaction is not completed, Fitch could affirm the ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Perspecta had $216 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Oct. 2, 2020. The company also had access to an undrawn $750 million revolving credit facility that expires Aug. 31, 2024. Fitch's expectation of $200 million to $300 million in annual post-dividend FCF over the forecast horizon also supports Perspecta's liquidity position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Manageable Debt Structure: Perspecta's maturities are staggered with TLA1 due 2021, TLA2 due 2024 and TLB due 2025. TLA2 and TLB amortization is $82.5 million and $5.0 million annually, respectively. Additionally, $66 million in principal outstanding of legacy Perspecta Enterprise Solutions LLC 7.45% notes are due 2029. The notes bear a guarantee of any principal and interest by <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>. (BBB+) as successor to <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Company</span>, which provided an irrevocable guarantee in 2008 upon its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Electronic Data Systems, LLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-09 June 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>.'s announced senior unsecured note issuance. HP will use the net proceeds to fund its concurrently announced tender offer. To the extent net proceeds exceed the tender, HP will use remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, working capital and general liquidity purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch affirmed HP following the company's 2Q20 earnings results with a Negative Outlook. The affirmation and Outlook reflected that despite the temporary impact of the coronavirus pandemic on HP's operating performance, the company can feasibly maintain its credit protection metrics in a way generally consistent with Fitch's rating sensitivities while pursuing its Value Creation Plan upon normalization of its end-markets. The agency's expectation is unchanged with regards to today's announced issuance given the reiteration by HP of its commitment to its 1.5x to 2x gross leverage target and guidance that it will operate at the lower end of its range in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pandemic Impact: HP's business was severely impacted in its second fiscal quarter ending April 30 with both print and personal systems (PS) businesses experiencing manufacturing and supply chain disruptions. Personal systems saw increased demand due to broad-based work from home orders although earlier manufacturing shutdowns in China prevented a demand surge from being fulfilled in the quarter leading to an elevated backlog. PS revenue fell 6% in constant currency comprising flat notebook sales, an 18% decline in desktops and 23% decline in workstations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With offices largely closed, print revenue declined 18% in constant currency with commercial hardware down 31% and supplies overall down 15%. HP said managed print services saw a 40% monthly decline in pages from February to April, and Indigo impression growth declined nearly 35pp over the same period. Manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia meant increased home inkjet demand also could not be fulfilled. Logistics costs were elevated due to lockdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP says its manufacturing capacity largely returned to normalized levels in early May. However, the company said it expects print supplies revenue in 3Q20 to be more pressured than 2Q20 until workers return to the office. HP suspended FY20 guidance and gave a wider than typical EPS range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While uncertain, Fitch expects 3Q20 and 4Q20 revenue to decline to high-single digits reflecting severe high double-digit print declines that are only partially offset by a low double-digit PS revenue increase in Q320, reflecting backlog fulfillment and more typical single-digit growth in 4Q20. For the year, Fitch expects HP will generate about $54 billion of revenue reflecting a high-single digit decline from FY19. Fitch sees Print operating profit margins well below the company's typical 16% and sees some sequential PS margin declines, albeit still at relatively high levels, due to reduced commodity favorability and higher logistics costs. HP's comments regarding progress to its cost reduction targets and additional measures to control expense combined with its historical discipline suggest the company will be able to manage its margins through the remainder of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects HP's FY20 operating EBITDA margin will be in the high 8% range and will remain around this level over the rating horizon. Fitch's revenue outlook is significantly lower over the rating horizon on the assumption that HP's print business does not recover to FY18 and FY19 levels due to increased work from home beyond reopening that is not offset by increased home printing. Fitch also has updated its PS revenue growth assumptions in FY21 and FY22 to expect low single-digit declines given significant pull forward of demand and lower overall economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage & FCF Profile: Despite near-term operational challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic, HP has maintained strong credit protection metrics. HP's total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA (inclusive of debt attributable to trade receivable sales) was 1.3x at April 30, 2020, below Fitch's 1.5x positive rating sensitivity. Gross debt-to-FCF (post-dividend) was 3.4x, also below Fitch's 4.5x sensitivity. Fitch sees HP's gross leverage exiting FY20 at 1.7x while gross debt-to-FCF will be 6.9x owing to Fitch's expectation that FCF will be nearly $2 billion lower than FY19. Fitch expects HP's FCF will normalize from FY20 as working capital uses return to historical levels while operating EBITDA is roughly flat in dollar terms due to structurally lower (assumed) revenue, offset by cost discipline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assumes that HP continues to return $13 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases now through FY23 as opposed to through FY22 via allocation of 100% of FCF and incremental borrowings of between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. Leverage under this scenario rises to 2.0x, leaving no headroom to Fitch's sensitivities. To the extent operating performance is as weak or weaker than the agency's forecast, Fitch sees HP's credit protection metrics and overall business profile migrating to a level more consistent with 'BBB', as reflected in the agency's Negative Rating Outlook. However, this view is highly uncertain and subject to the ultimate normalization in workplace and consumer demand patterns, and HP's further ability to reduce it cost structure while maintaining its market position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Policy: While HP's operating performance is highly uncertain, the company does have flexibility to continue to maintain its relatively conservative capital structure by further delaying or even downsizing its Value Creation Plan. HP has committed to prudently maintain leverage at the lower end of its 1.5x to 2x range (calculated excluding share based compensation and debt attributable to trade receivable sales) during the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic impact. Further it has not necessarily committed to achieving the full $16 billion shareholder return by FY22 as originally announced while stressing its desire to maintain its credit rating. Fitch views HP's financial policy prudence within the context of its operating performance while maintaining its 'BBB+' IDR with a Negative Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This is supported by its post-separation track record of fiscal conservatism. Gross leverage has largely remained below 2.0x since FY15 and only temporarily exceeding in conjunction with the company's acquisition of Samsung's printer business. Additionally, the company has shown discipline in resisting a transaction with Xerox both due to that company's operational performance and potential capital structure impacts. While HP's Value Plan continues to represent a more aggressive financial policy, its concurrent adoption of an explicit leverage target and willingness to maintain it in the face of operational challenges is consistent its rating given operational uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Options: Fitch continues to believe secular pressure in the print sector warrants further industry consolidation. While a combination with Xerox appears to be off the table at this time, acquiring the company would provide HP with significant A3 and MPS share while reducing its indexation to consumer print which is declining at mid- to high-single digits. The combined entity could benefit from the cash flow dynamics of the PC business and HP's intention to maintain a more conservative capital structure in light of working capital swings and the potential for twin cyclicality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP's CEO recently said he saw strategic merit in a combination with Xerox. However, for the time being Fitch no longer assumes the risk of a pro forma capital structure that would be leveraging and require HP to maintain credit protection metrics above its stated leverage target or abandon its shareholder plan, which previously weighed on HP's rating. In Fitch's view this is offset by operational challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and its potential longer term impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect HP's ability to manage through a temporary shock like the coronavirus pandemic and address secular headwinds to a better degree than its comparably rated technology peers. Fitch believes HP's organic growth, profitability and FCF prospects are meaningfully greater than its most closely related peers and competitors, including <span class="companylink">Xerox Corporation</span>, Dell Technologies and <span class="companylink">Lexmark</span>. HP has improved its PC market share in an overall market that has faced continued pressures, and achieved revenue growth reflecting its product mix as well as supply chain scale amid component shortages. HP has also maintained its leading market share in the aggregate global printer market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP's profitability metrics are high for the 'BBB' category, reflecting its margin profile and FCF generation, and the company is poised to expand its margin owing to the announced restructuring plan. HP's financial structure is comparable to more highly-rated corporates, and the company enjoys significant financial flexibility. However, the underlying sector trend is limiting to the rating and operating performance challenges in conjunction with a shift to more aggressive financial policy continues to support a Negative Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assigned the lower of two available short-term rating options based on the following observations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch has determined the three-notch midpoint for HP's 'Financial Flexibility' factor is 'a-', below the minimum required of 'a' to achieve a higher short-term rating. HP has very comfortable liquidity consistent with an 'a' factor rating (Fitch believes HP would not have to use external funding in the next 12 months even under the very unlikely event of a severe stress scenario whereby the company loses access to external funding). However, Fitch assesses HP's Financial Discipline factor to be 'bbb' since HP is shifting away from its historical practice of maintaining significant headroom in its credit protection metrics, representing a material weakness in Fitch's view, constraining the factor rating and thus the short-term rating. HP has traditionally maintained a conservative financial policy in terms of leverage although this appears to be trending downwards as the company pursues significant shareholder return;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 'Financial Structure' factor is 'a' consistent with HP's leverage metrics;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Operating Environment factor (upper end of the rating band) is 'aa' given HP's geographic orientation heavily weighted towards developed economies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >No parent/subsidiary linkage is applicable, no Country Ceiling constraint was in effect for these ratings, and no Operating Environment influence was in effect for these ratings. Fitch adds its estimate of receivables factoring to total debt and adjusts working capital and cash flow from financing accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Agency's Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid- to high-single-digit revenue decline in FY20 reflecting sharp, double-digit print segment declines in 3Q20 and 4Q20, only partially offset by high single-digit growth in personal systems in 3Q20, with normalized growth in 4Q20. Roughly flat revenue growth over the rating horizon from FY-end 2020 levels;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP operating EBITDA margin of mid-5% in 3Q20 and mid-6% in 4Q20, stabilizing at around 7% over the rating horizon reflecting cost reduction efforts offsetting structurally lower revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Return of greater than 100% of FCF to shareholders in 3Q20 and 4Q20, while maintaining gross leverage (by HP's definition) at the lower end of HP's 1.5x-2x range. Return of at least 100% of FCF in FY21 and beyond with additional share repurchases financed through combination of balance sheet cash and incremental debt with total share repurchases of approximately $13 billion through FY23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Maturities refinanced opportunistically; short-term borrowings and estimated factoring debt held roughly constant over the forecast horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No M&A assumed though HP retains strategic flexibility to pursue transactions through reallocation of capital earmarked for share repurchases upon normalization of its end markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action/upgrade: --Sustained organic constant currency revenue growth; --Total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA expected to be sustained below 1.5x through a cycle; --Gross debt-to-FCF expected to be sustained at 3.5x or below through a cycle; -Further evidence of traction in growth and future initiatives; --Structural improvement in margins relative to peers; --Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy. Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action/downgrade: --Sustained negative revenue growth; --Total debt with equity credit-to-operating EBITDA expected to be sustained above 2.0x; --Gross debt-to-FCF sustained above 4.5x; --Accelerating declines in underlying PC and/or printing markets or increased competition therein; --Material M&A without the expectation of return-to-target leverage within 18-24 months; --Sustained shift toward aggressive financial policies and/or abandonment of leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity and Debt Structure: HP's liquidity is supported by $4.1 billion total cash and cash equivalents (approximately $3.8 billion in Fitch-defined readily available cash) at April 30, 2020. While HP historically maintained efficient access to its cash held abroad, Fitch assumes nearly unfettered access in light of U.S. tax reform. HP has access to its undrawn $4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which backs up its $6 billion CP program. Additionally, on May 29, 2020 the company entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility with $1 billion in aggregate lending commitments. HP had $613 million in CP borrowings at April 30, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views HP's revolver availability, readily available cash, and FCF as fully backstopping HP's CP program. Fitch expects HP will generate around $1 billion in annual FCF (post-dividend) in FY20 and in excess of $2 billion annually over the ratings horizon. HP's maturities are well staggered, the first being $648 million principal outstanding due in December, which is subject to HP's tender offer. Fitch assumes HP will refinance remaining maturities not tendered as they come due and may issue debt to fund share repurchases in excess of FCF while managing its capital structure to its leverage target.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-02 June 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>HP Inc</b></span>.'s Long-Term 'BBB+' and 'F2' Issuer Default Rating and associated debt ratings. The Rating Outlook remains Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The affirmation and Outlook reflect that despite the temporary impact of the coronavirus pandemic on HP's operating performance, the company can feasibly maintain its credit protection metrics generally consistent with our sensitivities while still ultimately returning $16 billion to shareholders albeit with diminished headroom from 0.3x on average in FY20 and FY21 to Fitch's 2x negative gross leverage sensitivity, reduced from 0.8x previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch sees greater uncertainty over the longer-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic on HP's print business and has modelled print revenue structurally lower at more than 25% below the roughly $20 to $21 billion achieved in FY18 and FY19. However, the company said it is tracking ahead of plan on its three-year $1.2 billion gross run-rate cost-reduction plan supporting its margin profile and ability to generate FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additionally, HP has reiterated its newly adopted commitment to a gross leverage target of 1.5x to 2.0x, and said that it expects gross leverage (by its definition) will be at the lower end of its target range until operations normalize following the coronavirus pandemic. This potentially implies reduced near-term share repurchases and a push-out in attaining $16 billion in total shareholder return beyond FY22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Finally, while the company's Value Creation Plan is intended to maintain strategic flexibility, the abandonment by Xerox of a merger transaction reduces uncertainty over HP's prospective capital structure and associated credit protection metrics, at least in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pandemic Impact: HP's business was severely impacted in its second fiscal quarter ending April 30 with both print and personal systems (PS) businesses experiencing manufacturing and supply chain disruptions. Personal systems saw increased demand due to broad based work from home orders although earlier manufacturing shutdowns in China prevented a demand surge from being fulfilled in the quarter leading to an elevated backlog. PS revenue fell 6% in constant currency comprising flat notebook sales, an 18% decline in desktops and 23% decline in workstations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With offices largely closed print revenue declined 18% in constant currency with commercial hardware down 31% and supplies overall down 15%. HP said managed print services saw a 40% monthly decline in pages from February to April and Indigo impression growth declined nearly 35pp over the same period. Manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia meant increased home inkjet demand also could not be fulfilled. Logistics costs were elevated due to lockdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP says its manufacturing capacity largely returned to normalized levels in early May. However, the company said it expects print in 3Q20 and until workers return to the office for supplies revenue to be more pressured than 2Q20. HP suspended FY20 guidance and gave a wider than typical EPS range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While uncertain Fitch expects 3Q20 and 4Q20 revenue to decline high-single digit reflecting severe high double digit print declines only partially offset by a low double digit PS revenue increase in Q3 reflecting backlog fulfilment and more typical single-digit growth in 4Q20. For the year, Fitch expects HP will generate about $54 billion of revenue reflecting a high single digit decline from FY19. Fitch sees Print operating profit margins well below the company's typical 16% and sees some sequential PS margin declines, albeit still at relatively high levels, due to reduced commodity favorability and higher logistics costs. HP's comments regarding progress to its cost reduction targets and additional measures to control expense combined with its historical discipline suggest the company will be able to manage its margins through the remainder of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects HP's FY20 operating EBITDA margin will be in the high 8% range and will remain around this level over the rating horizon. Our revenue outlook is significantly lower over the rating horizon on the assumption that HP's print business does not recover to FY18 and FY19 levels due to increased work from home beyond reopening that is not offset by increased home printing. Fitch also has updated its PS revenue growth assumptions in FY21 and FY22 to expect low single-digit declines given significant pull forward of demand and lower overall economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage & FCF Profile: Despite near term operational challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic, HP has maintained strong credit protection metrics. HP's total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA (inclusive of debt attributable to trade receivable sales) was 1.3x at April 30, 2020, below Fitch's 1.5x positive rating sensitivity. Gross debt to FCF (post-dividend) was 3.4x, also below Fitch's 4.5x sensitivity. Fitch sees HP's gross leverage exiting FY20 at 1.7x while gross debt to FCF will be 6.9x owing to our expectation that FCF will be nearly $2 billion lower than FY19. Fitch expects HP's FCF will normalize from FY20 as working capital uses return to historical levels while operating EBITDA is roughly flat in dollar terms due to structurally lower (assumed) revenue, offset by cost discipline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assumes that HP continues to return $13 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases now through FY23 as opposed to through FY22 via allocation of 100% of FCF and incremental borrowings of between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. Leverage under this scenario rises to 2.0x, leaving no headroom to Fitch's sensitivities. To the extent operating performance is as weak or weaker than our forecast then we see HP's credit protection metrics and overall business profile migrating to a level more consistent with 'BBB', as reflected in our Negative Rating Outlook. However, this view is highly uncertain and subject to the ultimate normalization in workplace and consumer demand patterns and HP's further ability to reduce it cost structure while maintaining its market position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Policy: While HP's operating performance is highly uncertain, the company does have flexibility to continue to maintain its relatively conservative capital structure by further delaying or even downsizing its Value Creation Plan. HP has committed to prudently maintain leverage at the lower end of its 1.5x to 2x range (calculated excluding share based compensation and debt attributable to trade receivable sales) during the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic impact. Further it has not necessarily committed to achieving the full $16 billion shareholder return by FY22 as originally announced while stressing its desire to maintain its credit rating. Fitch views HP's financial policy prudence within the context of its operating performance while maintaining its 'BBB+' IDR with a Negative Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This is supported by its post-separation track record of fiscal conservatism. Gross leverage has largely remained below 2.0x since FY15 and only temporarily exceeding in conjunction with the company's acquisition of Samsung's printer business. Additionally, the company has shown discipline in resisting a transaction with Xerox both due to that company's operational performance and potential capital structure impacts. While HP's Value Plan continues to represent a more aggressive financial policy, its concurrent adoption of an explicit leverage target and willingness to maintain it in the face of operational challenges is consistent its rating given operational uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Options: Fitch continues to believe secular pressure in the print sector warrants further industry consolidation. While a combination with Xerox appears to be off the table at this time, acquiring the company would provide HP with significant A3 and MPS share while reducing its indexation to consumer print which is declining at mid to high single digits. The combined entity could benefit from the cash flow dynamics of the PC business and HP's intention to maintain a more conservative capital structure in light of working capital swings and the potential for twin cyclicality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP's CEO recently said he saw strategic merit in a combination with Xerox. However, for the time being Fitch no longer assumes the risk of a pro forma capital structure that would be leveraging and require HP to maintain credit protection metrics above its stated leverage target or abandon its shareholder plan, which previously weighed on HP's rating. In Fitch's view this offset by operational challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and its potential longer term impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect HP's ability to manage through a temporary shock like the coronavirus pandemic and address secular headwinds to a degree better than its comparably rated technology peers. Fitch believes HP's organic growth, profitability and FCF prospects are meaningfully greater than its most closely related peers and competitors, including <span class="companylink">Xerox Corporation</span>, Dell Technologies and <span class="companylink">Lexmark</span>. HP has improved its PC market share in an overall market that has faced continued pressures, and achieved revenue growth reflecting its product mix as well as supply chain scale amid component shortages. HP has also maintained its leading market share in the aggregate global printer market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >HP's profitability metrics are high for the 'BBB' category, reflecting its margin profile and FCF generation, and the company is poised to expand its margin owing to the announced restructuring plan. HP's financial structure is comparable to more highly rated corporates and the company enjoys significant financial flexibility. However, the underlying sector trend is limiting to the rating and operating performance challenges in conjunction with a shift to more aggressive financial policy continues to support a Negative Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch assigned the lower of two available short-term rating options based on the following observations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch has determined the three notch midpoint for HP's 'Financial Flexibility' factor is 'a-', below the minimum required of 'a' to achieve a higher short-term rating. HP has very comfortable liquidity consistent with an 'a' factor rating (Fitch believes HP would not have to use external funding in the next 12 months even under the very unlikely event of a severe stress scenario whereby the company loses access to external funding). However, Fitch assesses HP's Financial Discipline factor to be 'bbb' since HP is shifting away from its historical practice of maintaining significant headroom in its credit protection metrics, representing a material weakness in Fitch's view, constraining the factor rating and thus the short-term rating. HP has traditionally maintained a conservative financial policy in terms of leverage although this appears to be trending downwards as the company pursues significant shareholder return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 'Financial Structure' factor is 'a' consistent with HP's leverage metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Operating Environment factor (upper end of the rating band) is 'aa' given HP's geographic orientation heavily weighted towards developed economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >No parent/subsidiary linkage is applicable, no Country Ceiling constraint was in effect for these ratings, and no Operating Environment influence was in effect for these ratings. Fitch adds its estimate of receivables factoring to total debt and adjusts working capital and cash flow from financing accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid- to high-single-digit revenue decline in FY20 reflecting sharp, double-digit print segment declines in 3Q20 and 4Q20 only partially offset by high single digit growth in personal systems in 3Q20 with normalized growth in 4Q20. Roughly flat revenue growth over the rating horizon from FY end 2020 levels</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Non-GAAP operating EBITDA margin of mid-5% in 3Q20 and mid-6% in 4Q20, stabilizing at around 7% over the rating horizon reflecting cost reduction efforts offsetting structurally lower revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Return of greater than 100% of FCF to shareholders in 3Q20 and 4Q20while maintaining gross leverage (by HP's definition) at the lower end of HP's 1.5x-2x range. Return of at least 100% of FCF in FY21 and beyond with additional share repurchases financed through combination of balance sheet cash and incremental debt with total share repurchases of approximately $13 billion through FY23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Maturities refinanced opportunistically; short-term borrowings and estimated factoring debt held roughly constant over the forecast horizon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- No M&A assumed though HP retains strategic flexibility to pursue transactions through reallocation of capital earmarked for share repurchases upon normalization of its end markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Sustained organic constant currency revenue growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA expected to be sustained below 1.5x through a cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Gross debt to FCF expected to be sustained at 3.5x or below through a cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Further evidence of traction in growth and future initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Structural improvement in margins relative to peers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Articulation of and adherence to a more conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Sustained negative revenue growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA expected to be sustained above 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Gross debt to FCF sustained above 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Accelerating declines in underlying PC and/or printing markets or increased competition therein;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Material M&A without the expectation of return to target leverage within 18-24 months;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Sustained shift toward aggressive financial policies and/or abandonment of leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity and Debt Structure: HP's liquidity is supported by $4.1 billion total cash and cash equivalents (approximately $3.8 billion in Fitch-defined readily available cash) at April 30, 2020. While HP historically maintained efficient access to its cash held abroad, Fitch assumes nearly unfettered access in light of U.S. tax reform. HP has access to its undrawn $4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which backs up its $6 billion CP program. Additionally, on May 29, 2020 the company entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility with $1 billion in aggregate lending commitments. HP had $613 million in CP borrowings at April 30, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views HP's revolver availability, readily available cash, and FCF as fully backstopping HP's CP program. Fitch expects HP will generate around $1 billion in annual FCF (post-dividend) in FY20 and in excess of $2 billion annually over the ratings horizon. HP's maturities are well staggered the first being $648 million principal outstanding due in December. Fitch assumes HP will refinance maturities as they come due and may issue debt to fund share repurchases in excess of FCF while managing its capital structure to its leverage target.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Copyright © 2020 by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings Ltd</span>. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>

<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>. is registered with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</span> as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the "NRSRO").
