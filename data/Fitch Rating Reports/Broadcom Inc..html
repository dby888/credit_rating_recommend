<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-07 July 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned to <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span>'s proposed senior notes issue a 'BBB' rating. The notes will rank pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing and future senior unsecured obligations. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include organic investments, debt repayment and acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Financial Flexibility: Positive operating momentum from strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s virtualization products enhances financial flexibility. Free cash flow (FCF) will be higher and more stable due to the increasing mix of recurring maintenance and support net revenue associated with the software portfolio, which doubled to 42% in FY24 (year end Nov. 3, 2024) from FY23 with the <span class="companylink">VMware Inc.</span> acquisition. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts $15 billion-20 billion of annual FCF and expanded capacity for capital returns and acquisitions without weakening the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >More Conservative Leverage Profile: EBITDA leverage should remain below <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 2.0x positive leverage sensitivity over the longer term with only temporary increases to accommodate partly debt-funded acquisitions. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will structure acquisition funding to return EBITDA leverage to within the agency's rating sensitivities in the 12-24 months after deal close, consistent with the company's historical approach, including its most recent purchase of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>. Meanwhile, cash flow from operations (CFO) less capex/debt should average more than 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Revenue Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s revenue profile has strengthened from prior years. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s expansion of its hyperscaler customer set due to robust demand for AI infrastructure build-outs will drive long-term net revenue growth, although potential excess capacity at customers in the medium run may present a risk. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s more strategic engagement with <span class="companylink">Apple Inc.</span> will benefit semiconductor net revenue while reducing product volatility. Meanwhile, maintenance and support revenue in the infrastructure software segment supports more stable net revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Industry-Leading Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strong positions and high share of net revenue from its software portfolio result in the highest profit margins among similarly rated semiconductor peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA margins of roughly 60% through the forecast horizon and more stable EBITDA from higher recurring maintenance and support revenue associated with software. This net revenue mix also reduces capital intensity further, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largely outsourced manufacturing model, and strengthens FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Short-Term Ratings: The 'F2' short-term ratings reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strengthened FCF profile in conjunction with recent refinancing to improve liquidity through the rating horizon and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s increased confidence in the company's commitment to higher long-term ratings. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s financial flexibility rating factor for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is 'bbb+', supporting the 'F2' short-term ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability than <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V.</span> (BBB+/Stable) offset <span class="companylink">NXP</span>'s comparatively conservative financial policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s less conservative financial structure than <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable) is offset by its leading market position and greater diversification. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial policies are more opportunistic than <span class="companylink">Microchip Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), but are offset by higher market share and diversification and a stronger FCF profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--High-teens organic revenue growth in FY25 before moderating to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in FY26-FY27</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Stable profit margins with cost savings from <span class="companylink">VMware</span> integration offsetting slightly lower profit margins associated with sales to hyperscalers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess cash used for share repurchases</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Upcoming debt maturities refinanced and future acquisitions structured to sustain EBITDA leverage below 2.0x over the long term</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations of EBITDA leverage above 2.5x beyond 12-24 months following a leveraging acquisition or CFO less capex approaching 20% of debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations of organic revenue declines or market share losses from aggressive cost-cutting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained below 2.0x and CFO less capex/debt sustained above 30%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end-market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s liquidity is adequate and, as of May 4, 2025, was supported by $9.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a $4 billion commercial paper program, which was nearly fully drawn at quarter-end. The CP program is more than fully backstopped by an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring January 2030. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $15 billion-20 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is a leading provider of wired and wireless semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software, including virtualization and cloud computing software.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-06 January 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span>'s senior notes offering. The senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The company will use net proceeds to repay a portion of outstanding term loans related to the <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span> acquisition and for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Financial Flexibility: Positive operating momentum from strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s virtualization products enhances financial flexibility. FCF will be higher and more stable due to the increasing mix of recurring maintenance and support net revenue associated with the software portfolio, which doubled to 42% in FY24 from FY23 with the <span class="companylink">VMware Inc.</span> acquisition. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts $15 billion-$20 billion of annual FCF, up from more than $10 billion previously, and expanded capacity for capital returns and acquisitions without weakening the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >More Conservative Leverage Profile: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> should approach <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 2.0x positive leverage sensitivity in the near term and maintain EBITDA leverage below 2.0x over the longer term with only temporary increases to accommodate partly debt-funded acquisitions. As the company has historically and most recently with <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will structure acquisition-funding to return EBITDA leverage to within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating sensitivities in the 12-24 months post-deal close. Meanwhile, CFO-capex/debt should average more than 40%, up from mid- to high 30% more recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Reduced VMware Integration Risk: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has largely integrated the <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largest ever, but concerns over the impact of spending cuts on long-term innovation remain. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s FY24 net revenue was $12.5 billion, exceeding expectations, while positive bookings momentum points to solid FY25 net revenue growth. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> achieved its target reduction of quarterly <span class="companylink">VMware</span> operating expenses to $1.2 billion in FY24Q4 from more than $2.4 billion pre-acquisition; however, this includes cuts to product development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Revenue Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s revenue profile has strengthened from prior years. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s expansion of its hyperscaler customer set amid robust demand for AI infrastructure build-outs will drive long-term positive net revenue growth, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> remains concerned over potential excess capacity at customers in the medium run. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s more strategic engagement with <span class="companylink">Apple Inc.</span> will benefit semiconductor net revenue while reducing product volatility. Meanwhile, maintenance and support revenue in the infrastructure software segment supports more stable net revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Industry Leading Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strong positions and high mix of net revenue from its software portfolio result in the highest profit margins among similarly rated semiconductor peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA margins of roughly 60% through the forecast and more stable EBITDA from higher recurring maintenance and support revenue associated with software. This net revenue mix also reduces capital intensity further, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largely fabless manufacturing model, and strengthens FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher ST Ratings: The upgrade of the ST ratings to 'F2' from 'F3' reflects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strengthened FCF profile in conjunction with recent refinancing activities to improve liquidity through the rating horizon and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> increased confidence in the company's commitment to higher LT ratings. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> upgraded <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Financial Flexibility rating factor for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to 'bbb+' from 'bbb', supporting the higher of the two ST ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V.</span> (<span class="companylink">NXP</span>; BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset <span class="companylink">NXP</span>'s comparatively conservative financial policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">Marvell</span>; BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s less conservative financial structure is offset by its leading market position and greater diversification relative to <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>. Compared with <span class="companylink">Microchip Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial policies are more opportunistic, but are offset by higher market share and diversification and a stronger FCF profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-teens organic revenue growth in FY25 before moderating to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in FY26-FY27;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Stable profit margins with cost savings from <span class="companylink">VMware</span> integration offsetting slightly lower profit margins associated with sales to hyperscalers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> uses excess cash for share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> refinances upcoming debt maturities and structures future acquisitions aiming to sustain EBITDA leverage below 2.0x over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 2.5x beyond 12-24 months following a leveraging acquisition or CFO-capex approaching 20%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cost cutting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained below 2.0x and CFO-capex/debt sustained above 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end-market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to <span class="companylink">Apple Inc.</span>
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s liquidity is adequate and, as of Oct. 29, 2024, was supported by $9.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a $2 billion commercial paper program that is more than fully backstopped by an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Jan. 19, 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $15 billion-$20 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is a leading provider of wired and wireless semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software, including virtualization and cloud computing software thanks to its acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-20 December 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span> and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Broadcom Technology Inc., CA Inc. and VMware LLC at 'BBB'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also upgraded the short-term (ST) IDR and commercial paper (CP) ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span> to 'F2' from 'F3'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has revised the Rating Outlook for the affirmed ratings to Positive from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span>'s ratings and Outlook reflect the company's strengthening financial profile underpinned by higher and more stable profitability growth that increases <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s flexibility for acquisitions without stressing the balance sheet and will drive EBITDA leverage close to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 2.0x positive leverage sensitivity in the near-term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Financial Flexibility: Positive operating momentum from strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s virtualization products is strengthening financial flexibility. FCF will be higher and more stable due to the increasing mix of recurring maintenance and support net revenue associated with the software portfolio, which doubled to 42% in FY24 from FY23 with the <span class="companylink">VMware Inc.</span> acquisition. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts $15 billion-$20 billion of annual FCF, up from more than $10 billion previously and expanded capacity for capital returns and acquisitions without weakening the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >More Conservative Leverage Profile: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> should approach <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 2.0x positive leverage sensitivity in the near-term and maintain EBITDA leverage below 2.0x over the longer-term with only temporary increases to accommodate partly debt-funded acquisitions. As the company has historically and most recently with <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will structure acquisition-funding to return EBITDA leverage to within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating sensitivities in the 12 months-24 months post-deal close. Meanwhile, CFO-capex/debt should average more than 40%, up from the mid- to high-30% more recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Reduced VMware Integration Risk: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has largely integrated the <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largest ever, but concerns over the impact of spending cuts on long-term innovation remain. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s FY24 net revenue was $12.5 billion, exceeding expectations while positive bookings momentum point to solid FY25 net revenue growth. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> achieved its target reduction of quarterly <span class="companylink">VMware</span> operating expenses to $1.2 billion in FY24Q4 from more than $2.4 billion pre-acquisition but this includes cuts to product development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Revenue Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s revenue profile has strengthened from prior years. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s expansion of its hyperscaler customer set amidst robust demand for AI infrastructure build-outs will drive long-term positive net revenue growth, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> remains concerned over potential excess capacity at customers in the medium-run. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s more strategic engagement with <span class="companylink">Apple Inc.</span> will benefit semiconductor net revenue while reducing product volatility. Meanwhile, maintenance and support revenue in the infrastructure software segment supports more stable net revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Industry Leading Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strong positions and high mix of net revenue from its software portfolio result in the highest profit margins among similarly rated semiconductor peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA margins of roughly 60% through the forecast and more stable EBITDA from higher recurring maintenance and support revenue associated with software. This net revenue mix also reduces capital intensity further, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largely fabless manufacturing model, and strengthens FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher ST Ratings: The upgrade of the ST ratings to 'F2' from 'F3' reflects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strengthened FCF profile in conjunction with recent refinancing activities to improve liquidity through the rating horizon and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> increased confidence in the company's commitment to higher LT ratings. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> upgraded <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Financial Flexibility rating factor for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to 'bbb+' from 'bbb', supporting the higher of the two ST ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V.</span> (<span class="companylink">NXP</span>; BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset <span class="companylink">NXP</span>'s comparatively conservative financial policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">Marvell</span>; BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s less conservative financial structure is offset by its leading market position and greater diversification relative to <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>. Compared with <span class="companylink">Microchip Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial policies are more opportunistic, but are offset by higher market share and diversification and stronger FCF profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Assessment: Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Parent-Subsidiary Linkage criteria, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizes the ratings for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and its subsidiaries, including <span class="companylink">VMware</span>. After determining that a parent-subsidiary linkage between <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and <span class="companylink">VMware</span> exists, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> follows the stronger subsidiary/weaker parent path. The absence of legal ring fencing in <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s bond indentures and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s access and control, despite the company's intention to let <span class="companylink">VMware</span> operate on a standalone basis, support the case that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has access to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-teens organic revenue growth in FY25 before moderating to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the FY26-FY27;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Stable profit margins with cost savings from <span class="companylink">VMware</span> integration offsetting slightly lower profit margins associated with sales to hyperscalers;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> uses excess cash for share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> refinances upcoming debt maturities and structures future acquisitions aiming to sustain EBITDA leverage in below 2.0x over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 2.5x beyond 12 months-24 months following a leveraging acquisition or CFO-capex approaching 20%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cost cutting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained below 2.0x and CFO-capex/debt sustained above 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to <span class="companylink">Apple Inc.</span>
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s liquidity is adequate and, as of Oct. 29, 2024, was supported by $9.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a $2 billion CP program that is more than fully back-stopped by an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Jan. 19, 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $15 billion-$20 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to generally refinance upcoming debt maturities, which are manageable over the next two years but step up to more than $17 billion in fiscal 2027 and include $11.2 billion of term loans maturing Nov. 15, 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is a leading provider of wired and wireless semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software, including virtualization and cloud computing software with the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-26 September 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span>'s senior notes offering. The senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The company will use net proceeds to repay a portion of outstanding term loans related to the <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span> acquisition and for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Financial Flexibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increased mix of software infrastructure net revenue and execution on <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition-related targets to strengthen its financial flexibility. With software net revenue, pro forma for <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, accounting for more than 40% of total revenue, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates $10 billion-$15 billion of less cyclical annual FCF through the forecast. This would support sizeable incremental debt-funded acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases at the current rating level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Financial Discipline: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will sustain leverage metrics in line with the rating over the long term despite temporary weakening of leverage metrics to support its acquisition strategy. We expect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will structure incremental deal funding to ensure the company can continue using FCF for sufficient debt reduction to return EBITDA leverage back below 2.5x within 12 months-24 months post-acquisition closure, as it did with the <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s negative EBITDA leverage rating sensitivity is 2.5x, but <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s Fitch-estimated EBITDA leverage stood at 1.8x and 2.0x for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe this is largely due to the impact of a higher interest environment on <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s deal pipeline. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s leverage tolerance based on the company's financial policies framework. However, an incremental positive rating action would most likely require management's public articulation of a long-term leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space due to industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risks compared with semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> still expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to long-term ranges consistent with the current rating over the subsequent 12 months-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >VMware Acquisition: The acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> is <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largest deal to date and has meaningfully diversified its infrastructure software segment with the addition of faster-growing cloud-focused revenue. The combination has increased the mix of software revenue to more than 40% of total net revenue, compared to over 20% pre-deal, improving visibility with greater recurring maintenance and support sales. Integration is on track but still at risk from aggressive cuts to product development spending required to achieve synergy targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects secular growth in enterprise, hyperscale and service providers, as well as infrastructure software maintenance, to drive solid average revenue growth over the long term. <span class="companylink">VMware</span> increased recurring revenue and enabled cross-selling. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s semiconductor solutions segment will benefit over the near term from hyperscale spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and the company's strengthened relationships with leading smartphone makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s revenue diversification is high for the semiconductor sector, resulting in lower operating cyclicality than its semiconductor peers. The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> will roughly double the infrastructure software net revenue mix to more than 40% of total, even after accounting for strong semiconductor solutions revenue growth from robust AI spending. The subscription revenue associated with software is more stable than that of the semiconductor segment, particularly given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s significant merchant components businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These factors offset <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increased concentration on <span class="companylink">Apple Inc.</span>, which constituted 20% of net revenue in fiscal 2023 and 2022. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also expects robust demand for AI infrastructure will increase concentration to hyperscaler customers, which account for the vast majority of spending on AI, although <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is engaged with these customers on a multi-generational strategic basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins should remain among the industry's highest, with EBITDA margins in the low-60% range due to a high revenue mix of software assets and leading positions across a broad set of higher-value semiconductor solutions offerings. The company's software portfolio has also reduced profitability cyclicality due to considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s integration of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> is on track to achieve $4.4 billion of run rate operating expense savings in fiscal 2025, converging <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s operating profit margins with those of pre-acquisition <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V.</span> (<span class="companylink">NXP</span>; BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset <span class="companylink">NXP</span>'s comparatively conservative financial policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared to <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s less conservative financial structure is offset by its leading market position and greater diversification. Compared to <span class="companylink">Microchip Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial policies are more opportunistic, but are offset by its greater diversification and FCF profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Criteria, we equalize the ratings for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and its subsidiaries, including <span class="companylink">VMware</span>. After determining that a parent-subsidiary linkage between <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and <span class="companylink">VMware</span> exists, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> follows the stronger subsidiary/weaker parent path. The company intends to let <span class="companylink">VMware</span> operate on a standalone basis. However, legal ring fencing is absent in <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s bond indentures and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s access and control, which supports the case that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has access to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low double-digit organic revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and total revenue growth of roughly 40% with the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low double-digit total revenue growth in fiscal 2025 from strong AI demand and semiconductor end market recovery;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single-digit revenue growth in the later years of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Realization of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> cost synergies and a richer sales mix, driving modest profit margin expansion through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> uses excess cash for share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> refinances upcoming debt maturities and structures future acquisitions aiming to sustain EBITDA leverage in the 2.0x-2.5x range over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s public commitment to maintaining EBITDA leverage below 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to <span class="companylink">Apple</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 2.5x beyond 12 months-24 months following a leveraging acquisition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cost cutting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects liquidity will remain solid for the current rating level. As of Aug. 4, 2024, it was supported by $10.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Jan. 19, 2026, which backstops the company's $2.0 billion CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $10 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is a leading provider of wired and wireless semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software, including virtualization and cloud computing software with the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-05 August 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded the Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span> and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Broadcom Technology Inc., CA Inc. and VMware LLC to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed the Short-term IDR and commercial paper ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span> at 'F3'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasing financial flexibility. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to structure ongoing acquisitions to return leverage metrics to levels in-line with the upgraded rating. Increased diversification and ongoing execution against <span class="companylink">VMware</span>-related target synergies will strengthen financial performance through the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Financial Flexibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increased mix of software infrastructure net revenue and execution on <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition-related targets to strengthen its financial flexibility. With software net revenue, pro forma for <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, accounting for more than 40% of total, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts $10 billion-$15 billion of less cyclical annual FCF through the forecast, supporting sizeable incremental debt-funded acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases at the current rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Financial Discipline: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will sustain leverage metrics in-line with the rating over the long-term despite temporary weakening of leverage metrics to support its acquisition strategy. We expect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will structure incremental deal funding such that the company can continue using FCF for sufficient debt reduction to return EBITDA leverage back below 2.5x within 12-24 months post-acquisition close, as it did with the <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s negative EBITDA leverage rating sensitivity is 2.5x, but <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s EBITDA leverage has been a Fitch-estimated 1.8x and 2.0x for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe this is largely due to the impact of a higher interest environment on <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s deal pipeline. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s leverage tolerance based on the company's financial policies framework. However, an incremental positive rating action would most likely require management's public articulation of a long-term leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space due to industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> still expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with the current rating over the subsequent 12 months-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >VMware Acquisition: The acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> was <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largest deal to date and meaningfully diversified its infrastructure software segment with the addition of faster-growing cloud-focused revenue. The combination increased the mix of software revenue to more than 40% of company-wide net revenue, versus just over 20% pre-deal, improving visibility with greater recurring maintenance and support sales. Integration is on track but still at risk from aggressive cuts to product development spending required to achieve <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s synergy targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects secular growth in enterprise, hyperscale and service providers, as well as infrastructure software maintenance to drive solid average revenue growth over the long term. <span class="companylink">VMware</span> increased recurring revenue and enabled cross-selling. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s semiconductor solutions segment will benefit over the near term from hyperscale spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and the company's strengthened relationships with leading smartphone makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s revenue diversification is high for the semiconductor sector, resulting in lower operating cyclicality than its semiconductor peers. The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> will roughly double the infrastructure software net revenue mix to more than 40% of total, even after accounting for strong semiconductor solutions revenue growth from robust AI spending. The subscription revenue associated with software is more stable than that of the semiconductor segment, particularly given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s significant merchant components businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These factors offset <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increased concentration to <span class="companylink">Apple Inc.</span>, which constituted 20% of net revenue in fiscal 2023 and 2022. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also expects robust demand for AI infrastructure will increase concentration to hyperscaler customers who account for the vast majority of spending on AI, although <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is engaged with these customers on a multi-generational strategic basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins should remain among the industry's highest with EBITDA margins in the low-60%, due to a high mix of software assets and leading positions across a broad set of higher-value semiconductor solutions offerings. The company's software portfolio has also reduced profitability cyclicality due to considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s integration of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> is on track to achieve $4.4 billion of run rate operating expense savings in fiscal 2025, converging <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s operating profit margins with that of classic <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V.</span> (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset <span class="companylink">NXP</span>'s comparatively conservative financial policies. Compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd.</span> (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s less conservative financial structure is offset by its leading market position and greater diversification relative to <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>. Compared with <span class="companylink">Microchip Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial policies are more opportunistic, but are offset by its greater diversification and free cash flow profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Assessment: Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Parent-Subsidiary Linkage criteria, we equalize the ratings for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and its subsidiaries, including <span class="companylink">VMware</span>. After determining that a parent-subsidiary linkage between <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and <span class="companylink">VMware</span> exists, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> follows the stronger subsidiary/weaker parent path. The absence of legal ring fencing in <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s bond indentures and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s access and control, despite the company's intention to let <span class="companylink">VMware</span> operate on a standalone basis, support the case that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has access to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low double-digit organic revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and total revenue growth of roughly 40% with the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low double-digit total revenue growth in fiscal 2025 from strong AI demand and semiconductor end market recovery;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single-digit revenue growth in the out years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Realization of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> cost synergies and a richer sales mix driving modest profit margin expansion through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> uses excess cash for share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> refinances upcoming debt maturities and structures future acquisitions with an aim to sustain EBITDA leverage in the 2.0x-2.5x range over the long-term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s public commitment to maintaining EBITDA leverage below 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to Apple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 2.5x beyond 12-24 months following a leveraging acquisition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cost cutting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of May 5, 2024, was supported by $9.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Jan. 19, 2026, which backstops the company's $2.0 billion CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $10 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is a leading provider of wired and wireless semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software, including virtualization and cloud computing software with the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span>

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-08 July 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b>.</span>'s senior notes offering. The senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The company will use net proceeds to repay a portion of outstanding term loans and for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >VMware Acquisition: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s 2023 acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> diversified its infrastructure software segment with the addition of $13 billion of faster-growing cloud-focused revenue. The combination also increased the mix of software revenue to more than 40% of company-wide net revenue, versus just over 20% pre-deal, improving visibility with greater recurring maintenance and support sales. Nonetheless, integration risk includes the potential for aggressive cost cuts, given <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s lower than industry average profit margins from significant product development spending.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> funded the $69 billion acquisition, which included $8 billion net debt assumed from <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, in part with $30 billion of term loans. Pro forma for a full year of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> profit contribution, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates EBITDA leverage was 2.5x for the latest 12 months ended May 5, 2024 and should remain below <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s 2.5x long-term gross leverage target from achieving near-term acquisition-related cost synergies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthening Financial Flexibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increased mix of software infrastructure net revenue to strengthen the company's financial flexibility. With software net revenue accounting for more than 40% of total revenue going forward, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is likely to generate more than $10 billion of annual FCF. This would support both incremental debt funded acquisitions over the longer-term and opportunistic capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that mainly debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment-grade ratings over the subsequent 12 months-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects secular growth in enterprise, hyperscale and service providers, as well as infrastructure software maintenance to drive solid average revenue growth. <span class="companylink">VMware</span> increased recurring revenue and enabled cross-selling. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s semiconductor solutions segment is also poised to benefit over the near term from hyperscale spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure and the company's strengthened relationships with leading smartphone makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates is roughly a third of total revenue, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Semiconductor product exposure is largely to data center (DC) and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions have also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s credit profile is strong for the 'BBB-' rating with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions support its operating profile strength. Higher profitability and low capital intensity are driving FCF growth and strengthening the financial profile, even as incremental deals are likely to be mainly debt-funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V.</span> (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset <span class="companylink">NXP</span>'s comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd.</span> (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>. Compared with <span class="companylink">Microchip Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is more aggressively positioned from a financial policies perspective due to a focus on acquisitions in infrastructure software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Assessment: Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Parent-Subsidiary Linkage criteria, we equalize the ratings for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and its subsidiaries, including <span class="companylink">VMware</span>. After determining that a parent-subsidiary linkage between <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and <span class="companylink">VMware</span> exists, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> follows the stronger subsidiary/weaker parent path. The absence of legal ring fencing in <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s bond indentures and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s access and control, despite the company's intention to let <span class="companylink">VMware</span> operate on a standalone basis, support the case that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has access to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth in the mid-30% for fiscal 2024 mainly driven by addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive low- to mid-single digit organic revenue growth through the remainder of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins in the high 50% expanding to 60% through the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Management refinances upcoming debt maturities, including term loans incurred to fund <span class="companylink">VMware</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Management prioritizes capital returns with pre-dividend FCF as the company integrates <span class="companylink">VMware</span> and de-levers to achieve management's long-term EBITDA leverage target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s public commitment to maintaining EBITDA leverage below 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to <span class="companylink">Apple</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage to be sustained above 3.0x, driven by debt-funded acquisitions without subsequent debt reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of May 5, 2024, was supported by $9.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Jan. 19, 2026, which backstops the company's $2.0 billion CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $10 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is a leading provider of wired and wireless semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software, including virtualization and cloud computing software with the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-29 November 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed at 'BBB-' the Long-Term (LT) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b>.</span> and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Broadcom Technology, Inc. and CA, Inc. Fitch has also affirmed the Short-Term IDR and commercial paper (CP) ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b>.</span> at 'F3'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has resolved the Rating Watch Negative on <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span> following the Nov. 22, 2023 close of <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, and downgraded the LT IDR and senior unsecured ratings to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which now includes <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strong financial flexibility and leading positions across a diversified set of end markets, including recurring software revenue accounting for more than 20% of consolidated revenue. Its opportunistic financial policies will support debt-funded acquisitions and capital returns with FCF, constraining positive rating actions absent a public commitment to tighter long-term leverage. Pro forma for the <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition close, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates EBITDA leverage is approximately 3.0x, excluding projected cost synergies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s IDR reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s assessment that the parent-subsidiary linkage between the stronger subsidiary, <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, and weaker parent, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>, is open due to a lack of legal ring fencing and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s access and control. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has full access to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s cash flows, which supports the equalization of the ratings at 'BBB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >VMware Acquisition: The acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> strengthens <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile by diversifying its infrastructure software segment with the addition of $13 billion of faster-growing cloud-focused revenue. The combination also increases the mix of software revenue to more than 40% of company-wide revenue, versus just over 20% pre-deal, improving visibility with greater recurring maintenance and support sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> funded the $69 billion acquisition, which includes $8 billion net debt assumed from <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, in part with $30 billion of term loans. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates pro forma EBITDA leverage at approximately 3x but approaching the company's 2.5x longer-term gross leverage target in fiscal 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Risks include the potential for aggressive cost cuts, given <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s lower than industry average profit margins from significant product development spending. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is targeting growing operating EBITDA to $8.0 billion from roughly $4.5 billion over the 12 months-24 months post-close, much of it from cost cuts rather than accelerating revenue growth. <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s spending is higher than that of its peers, but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes spending has been instrumental to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s rapid growth and reinforcing the company's market leadership positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Assessment: Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Parent-Subsidiary Linkage criteria, we equalize the ratings for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and its subsidiaries, including <span class="companylink">VMware</span>. After determining that a parent-subsidiary linkage between <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> and <span class="companylink">VMware</span> exists, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> follows the stronger subsidiary/weaker parent path. The absence of legal ring fencing in <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s bond indentures and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s access and control, despite the company's intention to let <span class="companylink">VMware</span> operate on a standalone basis, support the case that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has access to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that mainly debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment-grade ratings over the subsequent 12 months-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Financial Policies: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has forecast $10 billion of annual FCF for the company, which should support post-deal debt reduction even as the company focuses on growing its dividend and repurchasing common shares. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will defend its investment-grade ratings, as it has done in the past and this transaction by issuing equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates EBITDA leverage closer to 2.0x for the latest 12 months ended July 30, 2023 and expects the company has the capacity to take gross leverage back to its long-term target of 2.5x from a Fitch-estimated 3.0x, pro forma for the deal. Over the long term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will have headroom to support incremental acquisitions under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 3.0x negative sustained gross leverage sensitivity for tuck-in acquisitions or capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects solid organic revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> driven by secular growth in enterprise, hyperscale and service provider, as well as infrastructure software maintenance. The <span class="companylink">VMware</span> transaction provides upside for the company's software business by increasing software sales mix to more than 40% of total revenue, increasing recurring revenue and enabling cross-selling opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates is roughly a third of total, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to data center (DC) and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions have also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s credit profile is solid for the 'BBB-' rating with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions support its operating profile strength. Meanwhile, higher profitability and low capital intensity are driving FCF growth and strengthening the financial profile, even as incremental deals are likely to be mainly debt-funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc.</span> (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V.</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd.</span> (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>. Compared with <span class="companylink">Microchip Technology, Inc.</span> (BBB/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is more aggressively positioned from a financial policies perspective due to a focus on acquisitions in infrastructure software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenue is up by mid-single digits in fiscal 2023 before correcting in fiscal 2024 by low-single digits. The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> would result in total revenue growth in the mid-30% for fiscal 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenues resume mid-single digit growth in fiscal 2025 before moderating to low-single digits in fiscal 2026. The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> does not meaningfully impact these growth rates in the out years but will likely support slightly higher growth over time;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating EBITDA margins finish fiscal 2023 near current 63% but moderate to 60% through the forecast period on an organic basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s mid-30% operating EBITDA margins are dilutive to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s organic operating EBITDA margins near-60% but cost actions drive profit margins expansion from the low- to mid-50% through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> prioritizes share repurchases and dividend growth with FCF, assuming profitability growth drives sufficient deleveraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s public commitment to maintaining EBITDA leverage below 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to <span class="companylink">Apple</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained above 3.0x, driven by debt-funded acquisitions without subsequent debt reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of July 30, 2023, was supported by $12.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Jan. 19, 2026, which backstops the company's $2.0 billion CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $10 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> provides semiconductors for data center, telecom, enterprise, and embedded networking applications, as well as software for mainframe, business operations, cyber-security, and storage area networking. <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc.</span> adds virtualization and cloud computing software to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s offerings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-21 September 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BBB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Broadcom Technology, Inc. and CA, Inc. Fitch has also affirmed the 'F3' Short-Term IDR and commercial paper (CP) ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s strong financial flexibility and leading positions across a diversified set of end markets, including recurring software revenue accounting for more than 20% of consolidated revenue. Its opportunistic financial policies will support largely debt-funded acquisitions, including the potential $69 billion <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>. deal and capital returns with FCF and constrain positive rating actions absent a public commitment to tighter long-term leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >VMware Acquisition: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, if approved by regulators, will strengthen the acquirer's operating profile by diversifying its infrastructure software segment with the addition of $13 billion of faster-growing cloud-focused revenue. The combination will also result in software revenue representing more than 40% of company-wide revenue, versus just over 20% pre-deal, improving visibility with greater recurring maintenance and support sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will partially fund the $69 billion acquisition, which includes $8 billion net debt assumed from <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, with $30 of term loans. The closing is still subject to customary regulatory approvals. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts pro forma EBITDA leverage at about mid-3x but approaching the company's 2.5x longer-term gross leverage target in fiscal 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Risks include the potential for aggressive cost cuts, given <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s lower than industry average profit margins from significant product development spending. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is targeting growing operating EBITDA to $8.5 billion from roughly $5.0 billion over the 12-24 months post-close, much of it from cost cuts rather than accelerating revenue growth. <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s spending is higher than that of its peers, but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes spending has been instrumental to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s rapid growth and reinforcing the company's market leadership positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that mainly debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment-grade ratings over the subsequent 12-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Financial Policies: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has forecast $10 billion of annual FCF for the company, which should support post-deal debt reduction even as the company focuses on growing its dividend and repurchasing common shares. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will defend its investment-grade ratings, as it has done in the past by issuing preferred equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates EBITDA leverage closer to 2.0x for the latest 12 months ended July 30, 2023 and expects the company has the capacity to take gross leverage back to its long-term target of 2.5x from the estimated mid-3.0x, pro forma for the deal. Over the long term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will have headroom to support incremental acquisitions under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 3.0x negative sustained gross leverage sensitivity for tuck-in acquisitions or capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects solid organic revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> driven by secular growth in enterprise, hyperscale and service provider, as well as infrastructure software maintenance. The <span class="companylink">VMware</span> transaction provides upside for the company's software business by increasing software sales mix to more than 40% of total revenue, increasing recurring revenue and enabling cross-selling opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates is roughly a third of total, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to data center (DC) and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions have also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is solid for the 'BBB-' rating with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions support its operating profile strength. Meanwhile, higher profitability and low capital intensity are driving FCF growth and strengthening the financial profile, even as incremental deals are likely to be mainly debt-funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V</span>. (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>. Compared with <span class="companylink">Microchip</span>, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is more aggressively positioned from a financial policies perspective due to a focus on acquisitions in infrastructure software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> closes <span class="companylink">VMware</span> at the end of fiscal 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenue is up by mid-single digits in fiscal 2023 before correcting in fiscal 2024 by low-single digits. The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> would result in total revenue growth in the mid-30% for fiscal 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenues resume mid-single digit growth in fiscal 2025 before moderating to low-single digits in fiscal 2026. The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> does not meaningfully impact these growth rates in the out years but will likely support slightly higher growth over time;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating EBITDA margins finish fiscal 2023 near current 63% but moderate to 60% through the forecast period on an organic basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s mid-30% operating EBITDA margins are dilutive to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s organic operating EBITDA margins near-60%, but cost actions drive profit margins expansion from the low- to mid-50% range through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Acquisition adds $30 billion of new debt in addition to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s $8 billion of pro forma existing net debt. Modest positive organic growth through the forecast period, given focus on legacy software assets and diversified semiconductor product offerings;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> allocates FCF for capital returns repurchases $5 billion of common shares over fiscal 2023 before shifting to prioritize the same amount of debt reduction, while dividends continue to grow by 10% annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s public commitment to maintaining EBITDA leverage below 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued end market diversification that offsets risks associated with exposure to <span class="companylink">Apple</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained above 3.0x, driven by debt-funded acquisitions without subsequent debt reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of July 30, 2023, was supported by $12.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring Jan. 19, 2026, which backstops the company's $2.0 billion CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $7.5 billion to $10 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b></span>. provides semiconductors for data center, telecom, enterprise, and embedded networking applications, as well as software for mainframe, business operations, cyber-security, and storage area networking.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-01 June 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has maintained the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) on <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>.'s 'BBB' ratings, reflecting <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>.'s proposed acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> that is still pending regulatory approvals but anticipated to close this fall. The RWN reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expectation for weaker credit metrics for the combined companies following the deal and uncertainty with respect to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s guarantee of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s debt, which could result in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizing <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s ratings with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s 'BBB-' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">VMware</span> Transaction: <span class="companylink">VMware</span> will strategically strengthen <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile by adding $13.5 billion of cloud revenue to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s primarily on-premise slower growing software franchises. The acquisition will also result in software revenue representing nearly half of combined company revenue, with the remainder from semiconductor solutions. Risks include the potential for aggressive cost cuts, given <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s lower than industry average profit margins, given significant product development spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The proposed acquisition is for a total consideration of $61 billion and the assumption of $8 billion of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s net debt. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will fund the acquisition with $32 billion of new fully committed debt financing from a consortium of banks. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts gross leverage, measured as pro forma total debt/operating EBITDA, to be in the mid-3x range but approaching the company's 2.5x long-term gross leverage target by fiscal 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Policies: On a standalone basis, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">VMware</span> will continue to use FCF for tuck-in acquisitions, share repurchases and deleveraging, targeting gross leverage below 2.5x. In contrast, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will focus on larger infrastructure software acquisitions that will require considerable debt financing as the company will continue to buy back common stock. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects periods of elevated gross leverage from deals followed by debt reduction and profitability growth to return gross leverage to its long-term 2.5x target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Standalone FCF Profile: We expect <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s FCF profile will remain strong, driven by operating leverage from mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and continued low capital intensity. An increasing software-as-a-service (SaaS) mix initially pressures profit margins but should increase consistency and gradually drive margin expansion over time, as <span class="companylink">VMware</span> achieves scale in SaaS. Fitch forecasts $3 billion-$4 billion of annual FCF, with FCF margins in the mid-20% range, down from mid-30% in recent years, due to slowing unearned revenue growth associated with the increasing SaaS mix and higher interest expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Diversified and Recurring Revenue: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s diversified and increasingly recurring revenue base supports more even revenue growth. Its complete portfolio allows it to connect applications and data across secure networks via on-premise, cloud and edge environments for a diversified set of customers and end markets. Revenue growth for <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s subscription and SaaS businesses, which represented 30% of combined revenue in fiscal 2023, should accelerate and represent nearly half of revenue by fiscal 2025, enhancing visibility relative to declining license revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Meaningful Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects investment intensity will remain fixed at roughly 20% of revenue, as R&D investment supports continued technology leadership, reflected by <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s strong market leadership. We believe high R&D spending is required for cloud growth, particularly within the context of a shifting competitive landscape, as <span class="companylink">VMware</span> faces a more diversified set of competitors. These include off-premise compute resources, including public cloud providers with considerably greater resources and financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s technology leadership, large and diversified installed customer base, and full suite of products and services should support solid organic revenue growth and FCF. The company's growth profile across a broad set of capabilities, including robust adoption of the subscription and SaaS model, supports <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation for mid-single-digit organic growth through fiscal years 2021-2025. <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s operating profile is aligned with ratings in the high 'BBB' or low 'A' categories, while the company's standalone financial structure is in the low-to mid-'BBB' range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Relative to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>, <span class="companylink">VMware</span> is well positioned from a financial profile, given the company's focus mainly on organic growth opportunities, which are solid given ongoing hybrid cloud optimization. This allows <span class="companylink">VMware</span> to return FCF to shareholders while maintaining solid credit metrics. Financial policies have been consistent since separating from <span class="companylink">Dell Technologies, Inc</span>. and in line with ratings. This contrasts starkly with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>, which continues to outperform from an operating perspective but remains aggressive, using FCF and growing cash balances for a hefty dividend and accelerating share repurchases rather than pre-funding the VMware acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, <span class="companylink">VMware</span> is weakly positioned, given the market positions that <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> enjoys in its operating system business but, more importantly, its cloud service provider business. Profit margins reflect not just <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s relative value but also its significantly greater financial flexibility and scale, which absorbs significant investment requirements. <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s financial structure and liquidity positions are also significant differentiators from a financial profile perspective, resulting in stated financial policy being less relevant to the company's 'ratings.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">VMware</span> compares favorably with <span class="companylink">Oracle Corp</span>. (BBB/Negative), given its significantly more disciplined financial policies. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>'s market position is stronger, given its deeply embedded infrastructure customers, although its cloud businesses are arguably less competitive than those of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, given the latter's pioneering of virtual machines technology, strong products and agnostic solutions offerings. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> has significantly greater financial flexibility and higher profitability but its ability to unwind long-standing aggressive capital returns continues to pressure the ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions Within Our Rating (Standalone) Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue grows by low single digits in fiscal 2024 reflecting maturation of the product refresh cycle and inventory digestion;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Growth resumes with DC spending in FY25 as workload optimization resumes in earnest;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins contract to the low-30% due to lower revenue levels and gradually resume through the forecast period to the mid-30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex is 3% of revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt is refinanced and modestly upsized through the forecast period to support capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive rating action is unlikely, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure pro forma for the acquisition. However, on a standalone basis, the following factors could lead to positive rating action:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for continued pro forma mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with stable profit margins, including operating EBITDA margins in the mid-30% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A public EBITDA leverage target below 2.5x, or below 2.0x on a post-spinoff standalone basis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> consummates the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> as planned, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizes the ratings under our parent-subsidiary linkage criteria;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a standalone basis, organic revenue decline with stable profit margins or organic revenue growth with meaningful profit margin degradation, including operating EBITDA margins below 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a standalone basis, expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s liquidity was adequate and, as of Feb. 3, 2023, was supported by $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring on September 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation for $3.5 billion to $4 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>. is a virtualization and cloud computing software provider founded in 1998. Its strategy leverages capabilities in visibility, operations, automation, security, governance and container management with core competencies in virtual machines, containers and Kubernetes.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-01 June 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the long-term 'BBB-' and short-term 'F3' ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>. and the 'BBB-' long-term ratings for its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Broadcom Technology, Inc. and <span class="companylink">CA, Inc</span>. on the company's announcement that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s solid financial flexibility and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that the company will bring credit metrics back in-line with the 'BBB-' rating in the 12-24 months following the deal's close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >VMware Acquisition: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will partially fund the $69 billion acquisition, which includes $8 billion net debt assumed from <span class="companylink">VMware</span>, with $32 billion of new fully-committed debt financing from a consortium of banks. The closing (currently anticipated for mid-2023) is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts pro forma total debt to operating EBITDA (gross leverage) at about mid-3x but approaching the company's 2.5x longer-term gross leverage target in fiscal 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >From a strategic perspective, <span class="companylink">VMware</span> will strengthen <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile by adding nearly $13 billion of faster growing cloud annual revenue to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largely on-premise slower growing software franchises. The combination will also result in software revenue representing nearly half of company-wide revenue, versus just over a third pre-deal, improving visibility with greater recurring maintenance and support sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, risks include the potential for aggressive cost cuts, given <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s lower than industry average profit margins from significant product development spending. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is targeting growing operating EBITDA to $8.5 billion from $4.7 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2022, much of it from cost cuts rather than just accelerating revenue growth. <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s spending is higher than that of its peers, but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes spending has been instrumental to <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s rapid growth and reinforcing the company's market leadership positions, which aggressive rationalization could weaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The pace of cost reductions will be instrumental to the combined company's deleveraging story, given that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> simultaneously announced that its board of directors authorized another share repurchases program of up to $10 billion through fiscal 2023. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company would ultimately curtail stock buybacks to defend investment-grade ratings should demand conditions worsen meaningfully. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s earnings release pointed to a strong back half of fiscal 2022 and visibility into revenue growth in fiscal 2023, positioning the company for supporting both debt reduction and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that mainly debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment grade ratings over the subsequent 12-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Financial Policy: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast $7 billion to $10 billion of annual FCF, which should support post-deal debt reduction even as the company focuses on growing its dividend and repurchasing common shares. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will defend its investment-grade ratings, as it has done in the past by issuing preferred equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) was 2.3x for the latest 12 months ended May 1, 2022, and expects the company has capacity to take gross leverage back to its long-term target of 2.5x from the estimated mid-3.0x, pro forma for the deal. Over the long term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will have headroom to support incremental acquisitions under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 3.0x negative sustained gross leverage sensitivity for tuck-in acquisitions or capital returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects solid organic revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> in fiscal 2022 driven by secular growth in enterprise, hyperscale and service provider, as well as infrastructure software maintenance. Supply constraints remain a concern more broadly, particularly within the context of ongoing supply chain constraints, but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes secular growth drivers bode well for demand over the longer term. The <span class="companylink">VMware</span> transaction provides upside for the company's software business by increasing software sales mix to nearly 50% of total revenue, increasing recurring revenue and enabling cross-selling opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates is roughly a third of total, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to data center (DC) and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions have also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is solid for the 'BBB-' rating with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions support its operating profile strength. Meanwhile, higher profitability and low capital intensity are driving FCF growth and strengthening the financial profile, even as incremental deals are likely to be mainly debt-funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V</span>. (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenue is up by mid-teens in fiscal 2022, driven by broad-based demand strength and constructive pricing environment, followed by a macro-economic fueled downturn in fiscal 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> closes the <span class="companylink">VMware</span> acquisition at the end of fiscal 2023 and <span class="companylink">VMware</span> adds mid-single digit revenue growth to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s low- to mid-single digit revenue growth through the remainder of the forecast period. This excludes meaningful contributions from revenue cross-selling actions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s organic operating EBITDA margins remain in the low-60% in fiscal 2022 and decline slightly in fiscal 2023 as the result of lower revenue levels;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The addition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s mid-30% operating EBITDA margins are dilutive to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s organic operating EBITDA margins near-60% but cost actions drive profit margins expansion from the low- to mid-50% through the forecast period;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-01 June 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has placed <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>.'s 'BBB' ratings on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) following the announcement that <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>. will acquire <span class="companylink">VMware</span> for $61 billion and the assumption of $8 billion of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s net debt. The RWN reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation for weaker credit metrics for the combined companies post-deal and uncertainty with respect to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s guarantee of <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s debt, which could result in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizing <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s ratings with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s 'BBB-' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will partially fund the acquisition with $32 billion of new fully-committed debt financing from a consortium of banks. At close (currently anticipated for mid-2023) is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts pro forma total debt to operating EBITDA (gross leverage) in the mid-3x but approaching the company's 2.5x longer-term gross leverage target in fiscal 2025. This compares with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for standalone <span class="companylink">VMware</span> gross leverage below 2.5x (estimated 2.7x for FYE Jan. 28, 2022).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >From a strategic perspective, <span class="companylink">VMware</span> will strengthen <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile by adding nearly $13 billion of faster growing cloud annual revenue to <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s largely on-premise slower growing software franchises. The combination will also result in software revenue representing nearly half of combined company revenue with the remainder from semiconductor solutions. Risks include the potential for aggressive cost cuts, given <span class="companylink">VMware</span> lower than industry average profit margins from significant product development spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Policies: On a standalone basis, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">VMware</span> will continue to use FCF for smaller, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases, targeting gross leverage below 2.5x. By contrast, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will focus on larger infrastructure software acquisitions that will require considerable debt financing since the company will continue to buy back common stock. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects periods of elevated gross leverage from deals followed by debt reduction and profitability growth to return gross leverage to its long-term 2.5x target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Standalone FCF Profile: We expect <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s FCF profile will remain strong, driven by operating leverage from mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and continued low capital intensity. An increasing software-as-a-service (SaaS) mix initially pressures profit margins but should increase consistency and gradually drive margin expansion over time as <span class="companylink">VMware</span> achieves scale in SaaS. Fitch forecasts more than $3 billion of annual FCF with FCF margins in the mid-20%, down from the mid-30% in recent years, due to slowing unearned revenue growth associated with the increasing SaaS mix and higher interest expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Diversified and Recurring Revenue: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s diversified and increasingly recurring revenue base supports more even revenue growth. Its complete portfolio allows it to connect applications and data across secure networks via on-premise, cloud and edge environments for a diversified set of customers and end markets. Revenue growth for <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s subscription and SaaS businesses, which represented more than 25% of revenue in fiscal 2022, should accelerate and represent nearly half of revenue by fiscal 2025, enhancing visibility relative to declining license revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Meaningful Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects investment intensity will remain fixed at roughly 20% of revenue as R&D investment supports continued technology leadership, reflected by <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s strong market leadership. We believe high R&D spending is required for cloud growth, particularly within the context of a shifting competitive landscape, as <span class="companylink">VMware</span> faces a more diversified set of competitors. These include off-premise compute resources, including public cloud providers with considerably greater resources and financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s technology leadership, large and diversified installed customer base and full suite of products and services should support solid organic revenue growth and FCF. The company's growth profile across a broad set of capabilities, including robust adoption of the subscription and SaaS model, supports <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation for mid-single-digit organic growth through fiscal years 2021-2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This contrasts with competitors, including <span class="companylink">Citrix Systems, Inc</span>. (BBB/RWN), which focuses on a narrower set of capabilities even as it shares <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s significant customer and end-market diversification. <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s operating profile is aligned with ratings in the high 'BBB' or low 'A' categories, while the company's standalone financial structure is in the low-to-mid 'BBB' range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth augmented by contributions from bolt-on acquisitions, resulting in a 6%-7% revenue CAGR through fiscal years 2021-2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Initially dilutive acquisitions and the ongoing shift to a subscription model weighs on profit margins, constraining operating EBITDA margins in the mid-30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex represents approximately 3% of revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">VMware</span> prioritizes FCF for acquisitions and shareholder returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive rating action is unlikely, given the <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure pro forma for the acquisition. However, on a standalone basis, factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for continued pro forma mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with stable profit margins, including operating EBITDA margins in the mid-30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Below 2.5x and, on a post-spin-off standalone basis, a public total debt-to-operating EBITDA target at or below 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> consummates the acquisition of <span class="companylink">VMware</span> as planned and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizes the ratings under our Parent-Subsidiary Linkage criteria;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a standalone basis, organic revenue decline with stable profit margins or organic revenue growth with meaningful profit margin degradation, including operating EBITDA margins below 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a standalone basis, expectations for total debt-to-operating EBITDA sustained above 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">VMware</span>'s liquidity remains adequate and, as of Jan. 28, 2022, was supported by $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation for $3 billion to $4 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-31 March 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB-' ratings to <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>.'s senior notes offering and senior notes associated with the company's refinancing exchange offers. The new senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing senior unsecured indebtedness, which as of Jan. 30, 2022 was $48.7 billion, including the undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility due 2026. The new senior notes from both the sale and exchange offers will not be guaranteed and will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness of <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use net proceeds from the notes sale and available cash to fund the redemption of $1.0 billion of 4.7% senior notes due 2025 and $944 million of 4.25% senior notes due 2026. The redemption is conditioned upon sufficient net proceeds and available cash to fund the redemption price, which equals 100% of the aggregate principal amounts plus make whole-provisions. Aggregate principal acceptance amounts of <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s offer to exchange five series of existing notes for a new series of notes due 2037 is subject to order of acceptance priority and sub-caps but will not exceed $2.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that mainly debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment grade ratings over the subsequent 12-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $5 billion-$7 billion of annual FCF would support a $15 billion-$20 billion acquisition with similar revenue and cash flow characteristics as those of recent deals, particularly given expectations <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> would issue preferred equity to accelerate deleveraging if necessary. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) was 2.4x for the latest 12 months ended Jan. 30, 2022, providing <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> with headroom under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 3.0x negative leverage sensitivity for tuck-in acquisitions or capital returns within the context of operational short-falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Growth Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects another year of solid organic revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> driven by secular growth in enterprise, hyperscale and service provider, as well as infrastructure software maintenance. Supply constraints remain a concern more broadly, particularly within the context of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes secular growth drivers bode well for demand over the longer-term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates is roughly a third of total, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to data center (DC) and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which it has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is solid for the 'BBB-' rating with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions support its operating profile strength. Meanwhile, higher profitability and low capital intensity are driving FCF growth and strengthening the financial profile, even as incremental deals are likely to be mainly debt-funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V</span>. (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by <span class="companylink">Marvell</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low-double digit revenue growth in fiscal 2022 followed by a modest correction in fiscal 2023, reflecting <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation for a downturn in calendar year 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low-single digit organic recovery in fiscal 2024 and growth through the remainder of the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margin of 60% through the forecast period from a structurally higher mix of software revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends equal to 50% of pre-dividend FCF and stock buybacks with sustained excess cash balances, absent announced deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Smaller acquisitions funded with cash flow or mixed funding for larger software deals with the expectation <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use post-close cash flow to reduce financing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-acquisition-related debt maturities are refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will maintain total debt to operating EBITDA below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margin expansion from continued positive organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt to operating EBITDA above 3.0x, driven by acquisitions without sufficient profitability or subsequent debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of Jan. 30, 2022, was supported by $10.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring 2026, which backstops the company's $2.0 billion CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $5 billion-$7 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b></span>., provides semiconductors for data center, telecom, enterprise, and embedded networking applications, as well as software for mainframe, business operations, cyber-security, and storage area networking.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-22 November 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BBB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecured ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, <span class="companylink">CA, Inc</span>. and Broadcom Technology, Inc. Fitch has also affirmed the 'F3' Short-Term IDR and CP rating for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s meaningful revenue diversification with an increasing mix of recurring software revenue, strong positions in focus markets and semiconductor sector leading profit margins. Its outsourced manufacturing model may dampen near-term revenue growth in the face of supply constraints but supports the company's strong cash flow profile. While <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is likely to remain acquisitive, Fitch believes the company is increasingly well positioned for the rating and able to return credit metrics to current levels within 12-24 months following large, mainly debt funded deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that mainly debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment grade ratings over the subsequent 12-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's forecast for $5 billion-$7 billion of annual FCF would support a $15 billion-$20 billion acquisition with similar revenue and cash flow characteristics as those of recent deals, particularly given expectations <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> would issue preferred equity to accelerate deleveraging if necessary. Fitch estimates total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) near 2.5x exiting fiscal 2021, providing <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> with headroom under Fitch's 3.0x negative leverage sensitivity and positioning the company more strongly for the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth Profile: Fitch expects another year of solid organic revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> driven by end markets recovering from the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and supply constraints that have lengthened lead times since last year. Double bookings remain a concern across the semiconductor space but Fitch believes broad-based supply constraints will extend recovering demand well into 2022. Meanwhile, increasing semiconductor content will support long-term revenue growth in <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s semi franchises, as will expanding with existing customers via its all-you-can-eat software model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which Fitch estimates is roughly a third of total, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to data center (DC) and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which it has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is strong for the 'BBB-' rating with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions support its operating profile strength. Meanwhile, higher profitability and low capital intensity are driving FCF growth and strengthening the financial profile, even as incremental deals are likely to be mainly debt-funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB-/Positive), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V</span>. (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by Marvell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Roughly 14% revenue in fiscal 2021 from strong and broad-based recovery in semiconductor demand, as well as the continuation of software growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest low-single digit positive organic revenue growth through the remainder of the forecast period from moderating semiconductor demand and slowing of software growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margin near 60% through the forecast period from a structurally higher mix of software revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flattish profit margins through the remainder of the forecast, driven by slowing organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends equal to 50% of pre-dividend FCF and stock buybacks with sustained excess cash balances, absent announced deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Smaller acquisitions funded with cash flow or mixed funding for larger software deals with the expectation <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use post-close cash flow to reduce financing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-acquisition-related debt maturities are refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will maintain total debt to operating EBITDA of 2.5x, from a combination of debt reduction and profitability growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margin expansion from continued positive organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt to operating EBITDA above 3.0x, driven by acquisitions without sufficient profitability or subsequent debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses from aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: Fitch expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of Aug. 1, 2021, was supported by $11.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring 2026. Which more than adequately backstops the company's $2.0 billion CP program. Fitch's forecast for $5 billion-$7 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-14 September 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB-' ratings to <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>.'s senior notes exchange offering. In a leverage-neutral transaction, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will offer to exchange up to $2.75 billion of new notes due 2035 and up to $2.25 billion of notes due 2036 plus a cash payment for two pools of existing senior notes with 2025-2030 maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Stable Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s revenue diversification with an increasing mix of recurring software revenue, strong positions in focus markets and semiconductor sector leading profit margins. Its outsourced manufacturing model may temper near-revenue term growth in the face of chip capacity shortages but supports the company's solid cash flow profile, even after its significant cash dividend. The rating and Outlook are constrained by Fitch's expectation that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the software space, likely requiring at least partial debt funding and limiting meaningful credit metric strengthening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The proposed exchange offers are subject to acceptance priorities and applicable sub-caps for each of exchange offer series, as well as early exchange offer participation. The exchange notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing senior unsecured obligations, including full and unconditional guarantees by Broadcom Technologies, Inc. and <span class="companylink">Broadcom Corp</span>. on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that at least partially debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment grade ratings over the subsequent 12-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth Profile: Fitch expects another year of solid organic revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> driven by end markets recovering from the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and supply constraints that have lengthened lead times since last year. Double bookings remain a concern for the semiconductor sector, but Fitch believes broad-based recovery will augment secular semiconductor content growth, and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s all-you-can-eat software model over the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which Fitch estimates was roughly 30% in fiscal 2020, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to DC and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which it has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is appropriately rated at 'BBB-' with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's operating profile is strong for the 'BBB-' category due to robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure remains weak for the 'BBB-' rating on an operating EBITDA basis, due to recent debt-financed acquisitions, but strong for the rating on a cash flow basis in part due to the company's low capital intensity. Fitch expects pre-dividend FCF to total debt of more than 25% and total debt to operating EBITDA below 3.0x through the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by Marvell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2021 from the continuation of software growth and solid semiconductor demand;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest positive revenue growth through the remainder of the forecast period from moderating semiconductor and slowing software growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Near-term operating EBITDA margin expansion from revenue growth and a higher mix of software sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flattish profit margins through the remainder of the forecast, driven by slowing organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends equal to 50% of pre-dividend FCF and stock buybacks only with sustained excess cash balances;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Smaller acquisitions funded with cash flow or mixed funding for larger deals with the expectation <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use post-close cash flow to reduce financing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-acquisition-related debt maturities are refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will maintain total debt to FCF closer to 3.0x and total debt to operating EBITDA of 2.5x, from a combination of debt reduction and profitability growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margin expansion from continued positive organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt/FCF in excess of 8.0x or total leverage above 3.0x, driven by acquisitions without sufficient profitability or subsequent debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for shrinking organic revenue or market share losses, likely from overly aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: Fitch expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of Aug. 1, 2021, was supported by $11.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring 2026. Fitch's expectation for $4 billion-$6 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions provider, <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b></span>., operates through two segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The semiconductor solutions segment includes semiconductor solution product lines, as well as its Internet protocol (IP) licensing. The infrastructure software segment includes mainframe, business operations and cyber-security software solutions, and its fiber channel storage area networking (FC SAN) business. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> provides semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center, telecom, enterprise, and embedded networking applications.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Stable Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s revenue diversification with an increasing mix of recurring software revenue, solid positions in focus markets and sector leading profit margins. Its outsourced manufacturing model may temper near-revenue term growth in the face of chip capacity shortages but supports its solid cash flow profile, even after its hefty cash dividend policy. The rating and Outlook are constrained by Fitch's expectation that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the software space, likely requiring at least partial debt funding and limiting meaningful credit metric strengthening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The proposed exchange consists of <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> offering up to $2.0 billion of new notes due 2033 in exchange for, in order of priority, <span class="companylink">Broadcom Corp</span>.'s $1.0 billion of 3.125% notes and the company's $2.25 billion of each of 4.7% and 3.15% notes. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will also offer up to $3.0 billion of new notes due 2034 in exchange for a second pool of notes consisting of, in order of priority, $1.4 billion of 3.625% notes due January 2024, $1.0 billion of 3.625% notes due October 2024, $2.5 billion of 4.25% notes due April 2026, $4.8 billion of 3.875% notes due January 2027, $350 million of 4.7% notes due March 2027 and $1.7 billion of 3.459% notes due September 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The exchange notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing senior unsecured obligations, including full and unconditional guarantees by Broadcom Technologies, Inc. and <span class="companylink">Broadcom Corp</span>. on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will remain acquisitive in the infrastructure software space, given still considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk compared with that of semiconductors. The company's track record suggests that at least partially debt-financed mid- to large-scale acquisitions are more likely than organically funded tuck-in deals. Nonetheless, Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to use post-deal FCF to return credit metrics to within long-term ranges consistent with investment grade ratings over the subsequent 12-24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth Profile: After stronger than forecasted operating performance in fiscal 2020, Fitch expects another year of solid organic revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> driven by end markets recovering from the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and supply constraints that have lengthened lead times since last year. Double bookings remain a concern for the semiconductor sector, but Fitch believes broad-based recovery will augment secular semiconductor content growth, and <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s all-you-can-eat software model over the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Software Revenue Diversification: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio should reduce longer-term operating volatility. Its increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which Fitch estimates was roughly 30% in fiscal 2020, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to DC and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer lifecycle products such as broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber-optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which it has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is appropriately rated at 'BBB-' with its strong operating profile offset by a track record for debt-funded acquisitions weighing on credit metrics. The company's operating profile is strong for the 'BBB-' category due to robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure remains weak for the 'BBB-' rating on an operating EBITDA basis due to recent debt-financed acquisitions, but strong for the rating on a cash flow basis in part due to the company's low capital intensity. Fitch expects pre-dividend FCF to total debt of more than 25% and total debt to operating EBITDA below 3.0x through the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s operating profile is stronger than those of its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital-intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductors N.V</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure should remain less conservative despite more recent partially debt-funded acquisitions by Marvell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2021 from the continuation of software growth and solid semiconductor demand;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest positive revenue growth through the remainder of the forecast period from moderating semiconductor and slowing software growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Near-term operating EBITDA margin expansion from revenue growth and a higher mix of software sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flattish profit margins through the remainder of the forecast, driven by slowing organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends equal to 50% of pre-dividend FCF and stock buybacks only with sustained excess cash balances;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Smaller acquisitions funded with cash flow or mixed funding for larger deals with the expectation <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use post-close cash flow to reduce financing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-acquisition-related debt maturities are refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will maintain total debt to FCF closer to 3.0x and total debt to operating EBITDA of 2.5x, from a combination of debt reduction and profitability growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margin expansion from continued positive organic revenue growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt/FCF in excess of 8.0x or total leverage above 3.0x, driven by acquisitions without sufficient profitability or subsequent debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for shrinking organic revenue or market share losses, likely from overly aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: Fitch expects liquidity will remain solid for the rating and, as of Jan. 31, 2021, was supported by $9.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $7.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring 2026. Fitch's expectation for $4 billion-$6 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-04 January 2021: LEAD PARAGRAPH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB-' ratings to <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>.'s senior notes offering. The senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing senior unsecured obligations. The company will use net proceeds to refinance existing debt and Fitch expects the issuance will be leverage neutral. Fitch's current Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings are 'BBB-' and 'F3', respectively, and the Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software assets, which now account for more than one-quarter of consolidated revenue and continue to add stability with recurring maintenance revenue at lower growth levels but higher profit margins. Demand trends for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s semiconductor franchises are mixed with 5G- and cloud-related businesses continuing to grow organically, but offset by those serving macro-economic sensitive markets such as satellite and set-top boxes. Overall, organic revenue should remain positive through the forecast period with modest contributions from acquisitions, more likely in fragmented infrastructure software markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects profit margins in-line with current levels, although an increasing software sales mix provides a roadmap for modest expansion, and strong but roughly flat FCF of $4 billion-$6 billion. Beyond the near term, Fitch anticipates leverage metrics will strengthen further from profitability growth enabling the company to maintain total debt to operating EBITDA below 3.0x. and pre-dividend FCF to total debt approaching 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Impact: Government-imposed stay-in-place orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic have constrained demand, but re-opening should result in recovery through fiscal 2021. Within this context, Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s exposure to infrastructure markets (DC and wireless) will largely offset its exposure to markets more sensitive to GDP (consumer and industrial). Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s higher recurring maintenance and support revenue from a growing mix of software sales also should support cash flow through the pandemic and recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to remain acquisitive, but the company will primarily focus on infrastructure software, given considerable industry fragmentation, and lower political and regulatory risk compared with the semiconductor industry. Fitch anticipates greater focus on tuck-in acquisitions, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s scale, but the ratings incorporate Fitch expectations that the company will use post-close post-deal FCF to repay incremental debt incurred to fund larger deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increasing End-Market Diversification: Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio reduces longer-term operating volatility. The company's increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which Fitch estimates was roughly 30% in fiscal 2020, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to DC and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer life-cycle products, including broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which the company has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s rating is in line with 'BBB-' peers, with the company's solid FCF profile offsetting its acquisition model. The company's operating profile is strong for the 'BBB-' category, due to robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure remains weak for the 'BBB-' rating on an operating EBITDA basis, due to recent debt-financed acquisitions, but strong for the rating on a cash flow basis due in part to the company's low capital intensity. Fitch expects pre-dividend FCF to total debt to approach 30% and total debt to operating EBITDA below 3.0x through the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> benefits from a stronger operating profile than its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital intensive, but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductor N.V</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset by NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure will likely remain less conservative, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s acquisition model that offsets its substantially stronger cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest positive revenue growth through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profit margins expand slightly from lower mix of consumer and higher mix of software revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends equal to 50% of pre-dividend FCF and stock buybacks only with excess cash balances;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Smaller acquisitions funded with cash flow cash or mixed funding for larger deals with the expectation <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use post-close cash flow to reduce a portion of financing debt.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-23 September 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>. at 'BBB-' and 'F3', respectively, as well as the Long-Term IDRs for wholly-owned subsidiaries, <span class="companylink">CA Inc</span>. and Broadcom Technology, Inc., at 'BBB-'. Fitch also revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. Fitch's actions affect $49.5 billion of debt, including the undrawn $5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software assets, which now account for more than one-third of consolidated revenue and continue to add stability with recurring maintenance revenue at lower growth levels but higher profit margins. Demand trends for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s semiconductor franchises are mixed with 5G- and cloud-related businesses continuing to grow organically, but offset by those serving macro-economic sensitive markets such as satellite and set-top boxes. Overall, organic revenue should remain positive through the forecast period with modest contributions from acquisitions, more likely in fragmented infrastructure software markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects profit margins in-line with current levels, although an increasing software sales mix provides a roadmap for modest expansion, and strong but roughly flat FCF of $4 billion-$6 billion, assuming the company continues to return 50% of pre-divided FCF in dividends. Fitch estimates total debt to operating EBITDA will end the fiscal year at roughly 3.4x, assuming no incremental debt reduction but fall to 3.0x in fiscal 2021 from term loan repayment and modest profitability growth. Beyond the near-term, Fitch anticipates leverage metrics will strengthen further with total debt to operating EBITDA below 3.0x. and pre-dividend FCF to total debt approaching 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Impact: Government-imposed stay-in-place orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic have constrained demand but re-opening should result in recovery through fiscal 2021, although the <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> acquisition will result in positive consolidated revenue growth for <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> in fiscal 2020. Within this context, Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s exposure to infrastructure markets (DC and wireless) will largely offset its exposure to markets more sensitive to GDP (consumer and industrial). Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s higher recurring maintenance and support revenue from a growing mix of software sales also should support cash flow through the pandemic and recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Acquisitive Nature: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to remain acquisitive, but the company will primarily focus on infrastructure software, given considerable industry fragmentation, and lower political and regulatory risk compared with the semiconductor industry. Fitch anticipates greater focus on tuck-in acquisitions, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s scale, but the ratings incorporate Fitch expects the company will use post-close FCF to repay debt incurred to fund larger deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Financial Policy: Fitch's believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s publicly articulated prioritization of FCF for debt reduction supports an investment-grade rating despite the potential for partially debt-funded incremental acquisitions. The dividend remains significant, but Fitch forecasts <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s annual FCF (after dividends) should still range from $4 billion to $6 billion, providing ample capacity for debt reduction. The ratings and Outlook contemplate no near-term stock buybacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increasing End-Market Diversification: Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio reduces longer-term operating volatility. The company's increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which Fitch estimates will be roughly 30% in fiscal 2020, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to DC and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer life-cycle products, including broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins are among the industry's highest, due to software assets and leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which the company has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions also increased predictability of profiles, given considerable recurring maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s rating is in line with 'BBB-' peers, with the company's solid FCF profile offsetting its acquisition model. The company's operating profile is strong for the 'BBB-' category, due to robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure remains weak for the 'BBB-' rating on an operating EBITDA basis, due to recent debt-financed acquisitions, but strong for the rating on a cash flow basis due in part to the company's low capital intensity. Fitch expects pre-dividend FCF to total debt to approach 30% and total debt to operating EBITDA of 3.0x in the near term. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> benefits from a stronger operating profile than its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital intensive, but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductor N.V</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability offset by NXP's comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure will likely remain less conservative, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s acquisition model that offsets its substantially stronger cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest positive revenue growth through the forecast period, helped in fiscal 2020 by the inclusion of <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> and tuck-in acquisition targets;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profit margins expand slightly from lower mix of consumer and higher mix of software revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends equal to 50% of pre-dividend FCF and no stock buybacks until fiscal 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Smaller acquisitions funded with cash flow cash or mixed funding for larger deals with the expectation <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use post-close cash flow to reduce a portion of financing debt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Use of FCF for debt reduction through fiscal 2021 to reduce total debt to operating EBITDA to 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will maintain total debt to FCF closer to 3.0x and total debt to operating EBITDA of 2.5x, from a combination of debt reduction and profitability growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margin expansion from continued positive organic revenue growth and target synergies for <span class="companylink">Symantec</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt/FCF in excess of 8.0x or total leverage above 3.0x, driven by acquisitions without sufficient profitability or subsequent debt reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses, particularly in radio frequency for wireless, likely from overly aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-05 May 2020: LEAD PARAGRAPH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has rated <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom, Inc</b></span>.'s senior notes offering 'BBB-'. The senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing senior unsecured obligations. The company will use net proceeds to refinancing existing debt and Fitch expects the issuance will be leverage neutral. Fitch's current long- and short-term Issuer Default Ratings are 'BBB-' and 'F3', respectively, and the Rating Outlook is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s still-weak financial structure. However, Fitch expects the company to prioritize the use of near-term cash flow for debt reduction and strengthen leverage metrics. Meanwhile, Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s exposure to datacenter (DC) and service provider markets, as well as its increasing sales mix of recurring subscription and services revenue, position the company for relative outperformance in the face of meaningfully lower aggregate demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Expectations for a lower mix of consumer sales and a full year of <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> results should enable <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to sustain profit margins, including operating EBITDA margins in the mid-50% range. Fitch forecasts near-term FCF in the $4 billion-$5 billion range, with the anticipation the company will moderate its dividend to half of pre-dividend FCF, as publicly guided. Assuming the use of nearly all of FCF for debt reduction, Fitch forecasts total debt to operating EBITDA just over 3.0x for fiscal 2020, not returning to below Fitch's 3.0x negative rating sensitivity until fiscal 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Impact: Fitch assumes government-imposed stay-in-place orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic will result in a significant first-half downturn and partial recovery beginning in 2H20, followed by slow growth to achieve full recovery on a run-rate basis exiting 2021. Within this context, Fitch believes end-market mix and financial flexibility will determine the coronavirus' impact on semiconductor credit profiles. Issuers more exposed to infrastructure markets (DC and wireless), including <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>, will outperform those exposed to markets more sensitive to GDP (automotive, consumer and industrial). Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s higher recurring maintenance and support revenue from a growing mix of software sales also should support cash flow through the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Appetite for Acquisitions: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to remain acquisitive, but the company will primarily focus on infrastructure software, given considerable industry fragmentation, and lower political and regulatory risk compared with the semiconductor landscape. Fitch expects greater focus on tuck-in acquisitions, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s scale, but the ratings incorporate larger deals funded temporarily with debt and subsequent deleveraging with cash flow and profitability growth. Despite very strong execution on achieving target synergies with the acquisition of <span class="companylink">CA, Inc</span>., Fitch remains less optimistic that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will be able to resume revenue growth from <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> with simultaneous headcount reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Financial Policy: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s publicly articulated financial policies support an investment-grade rating, despite Fitch's expectations the company will continue making partially debt-funded acquisitions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> indicated it will prioritize FCF for debt reduction to maintain investment-grade ratings, which Fitch believes will be essential to return leverage metrics in-line with a low 'BBB' rating. The company's dividend remains significant, but Fitch forecasts <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s annual FCF (after dividends) should range from $4 billion to $5 billion, providing ample capacity for debt reduction over the next 12-18 months. The ratings and Outlook contemplate no further stock buybacks after the company bought back roughly $12.7 billion of stock in fiscals 2018 and 2019, largely to offset the acceleration of equity grants in connection with the CA acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increasing End-Market Diversification: Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio reduces longer term operating volatility. The company's increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which Fitch estimates will be roughly 30% in fiscal 2020, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product-driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to DC and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end-market diversification, as well as longer life-cycle products, including broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins were among the industry's highest before pivoting to acquiring software companies, due to leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets, such as ethernet switching, fiber optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which the company has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions also strengthened the company's profit margin profile, given considerable maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s rating is in line with 'BBB-' peers, with the company's solid FCF profile offsetting its aggressive acquisition model. The company's operating profile is strong for the 'BBB-' category, due to robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification and leading market share positions. However, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure remains weak for the 'BBB-' rating, with elevated leverage metrics due to recent debt-financed acquisitions, which Fitch expects the company will continue to make. Fitch expects total debt/FCF to remain near 7.0x and total leverage in the 2.5x-3.0x range, although serial acquisitions resulting in total leverage stubbornly above 3.0x could result in negative rating actions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> benefits from a stronger operating profile than its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital intensive, but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductor N.V</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability, although NXP's Outlook reflects expectations for comparatively conservative financial policies. When compared with <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial structure will likely remain less conservative, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s acquisition model that offsets its substantially stronger cash flow. However, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s stronger profit margins have expanded as the company increases its software sales mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is down by midsingle digits overall in fiscal 2020, with meaningfully steeper negative organic growth in consumer markets, and partially mitigated by subscription revenue in the company infrastructure software and services businesses (roughly one-third of revenue when layering in a full year of <span class="companylink">Symantec</span>);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low growth through the remainder of the forecast period, with some inorganic growth in fiscal 2022 that bleeds into 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profit margins expand slightly, driven by expectations for lower consumer contribution (lower margins) and a higher mix of software revenue. Operating leverage will be less of a headwind because its only internalized manufacturing is in radio frequency filters for wireless handsets, which Fitch expects to decline significantly as a percentage of the overall sales mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends scale to equal 50% of pre-dividend FCF and no stock buybacks until fiscal 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest acquisitions aside from another $10 billion deal in fiscal 2022, which the company will fund half with cash flow and half with preferred equity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Use of FCF for debt reduction through fiscal 2021, since lower near-term profitability constrains the company's ability to delever as expected in fiscal 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will maintain total debt to FCF closer to 5.0x and total debt to operating EBITDA of 3.0x, from a combination of debt reduction and profitability growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBIT margin expansion from successfully achieving $2.5 billion of operating income on $3.5 billion of annual revenue for CA, and realizing close to $1 billion of synergies for <span class="companylink">Symantec</span>'s enterprise business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt/FCF in excess of 8.0x or total leverage above 3.0x, driven by acquisitions without sufficient profitability or subsequent debt reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses particularly in radio frequency for wireless, likely from overly aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s liquidity is adequate, and as of Feb. 2, 2020, was supported by: i) $6.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents; and ii) an undrawn $5 billion five-year RCF, which more than fully back-stops the $2 billion CP program. Fitch's expectation for $4 billion-$5 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity. In line with the company's guidance, Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use FCF and excess cash for debt reduction rather than share repurchases.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-07 April 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BBB-' long-term ratings and 'F3' short-term ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Broadcom Inc</b></span>., as well as the 'BBB-' long-term ratings for the company's wholly owned subsidiaries, Broadcom Technology, Inc. and <span class="companylink">CA, Inc</span>. (CA). Fitch also rated <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s senior notes offering 'BBB-', which will be pari passu with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s existing senior unsecured debt. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> plans to use net proceeds from the senior notes issuance to fund tender offer for three tranches of existing senior notes due in 2021 and 2022. The Rating Outlook remains Negative. Fitch's actions affect $49.7 billion of debt, including the undrawn $5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectation that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s credit protection measures will remain weak for the rating over at least the near term, despite the company's guidance to prioritize its use of cash flow for debt reduction following the Nov. 4, 2019 debt-funded acquisition of Symantec's Enterprise business. Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s exposure to datacenter (DC) and service provider markets, as well as increasing sales mix of recurring subscription and services revenue, positions the company for relative outperformance in the face of meaningfully lower aggregate demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch forecasts mid-single digit negative revenue growth even after layering in a full year of revenue from <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> for fiscal 2020, although visibility on the depth and duration of a downturn and the speed and magnitude of any subsequent recovery remains minimal. Expectations for a lower mix of consumer sales and the inclusion of <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> should enable <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to sustain current profit margins, including operating EBITDA margins in the mid-50%. Fitch forecasts near-term FCF in the $4 billion to $5 billion range with the anticipation the company will moderate its dividend to half of pre-dividend FCF, as publicly guided. Assuming the use of nearly all of FCF for debt reduction, Fitch forecasts total debt to operating EBITDA just over 3.0x for fiscal 2020 and not returning to below Fitch's 3.0x negative rating sensitivity until fiscal 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Appetite for Acquisitions: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> to remain acquisitive, but the company will primarily focus on infrastructure software, given considerable industry fragmentation and lower political and regulatory risk when compared with the semiconductor landscape. Fitch expects greater focus on tuck-in acquisitions, given <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s scale, but the ratings incorporate larger deals funded temporarily with debt and subsequent deleveraging with cash flow and profitability growth. Despite very strong execution on achieving target synergies with the CA deal, Fitch remains less optimistic that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will be able to resume revenue growth from <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> with simultaneous headcount reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Financial Policy: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s publicly articulated financial policies support an investment grade rating, despite Fitch's expectations the company will continue making partially debt-funded acquisitions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> indicated it will prioritize FCF for debt reduction to maintain investment grade ratings, which Fitch believes will be essential to return leverage metrics to in-line with a low-'BBB' rating. The company's dividend remains significant, but Fitch forecasts <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s annual FCF (after dividends) should range from $4 billion to $5 billion, providing ample capacity for debt reduction over the next 12-18 months. The ratings and Outlook contemplate no further stock buybacks after the company bought back roughly $12.7 billion of stock in fiscals 2018 and 2019, largely to offset the acceleration of equity grants in connection with the CA acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increasing End Market Diversification: Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s increasingly diversified revenue portfolio reduces longer-term operating volatility. The company's increasing revenue exposure in subscriptions and services, which Fitch estimates will be roughly 30% in fiscal 2020, is highly recurring and meaningfully offsets product driven volatility associated with <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s consumer business. Meanwhile, its semiconductor product exposure is largely to DC and service providers, providing meaningful customer and end market diversification, as well as longer life cycle products, including broadband and set-top boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Profit Margins: <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s profit margins were among the industry's highest before pivoting to making software acquisitions, due to leading positions across a broad set of infrastructure markets and wired infrastructure markets such as ethernet switching, fibre optic components and set-top boxes. The company's acquisitions have shifted the sales mix away from FBAR filters for handsets, in which the company has very strong share but less leverage with a consolidated customer set. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s software acquisitions have also strengthened the company's profit margin profile, given considerable maintenance and support revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s rating is in line with 'BBB-' peers, with the company's solid FCF profile offsetting its aggressive acquisition model. The company's operating profile is strong for the 'BBB-' category, due to robust profit margins, end-market and customer diversification, and leading market share positions. However, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s financial profile remains weak for the 'BBB-' rating, with elevated leverage metrics due to recent debt-financed acquisitions that Fitch expects will continue. Fitch expects total debt/FCF to remain near 7.0x and total leverage in the 2.5x-3.0x range, although serial acquisitions resulting in total leverage stubbornly above 3.0x could result in negative rating actions. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> benefits from a stronger operating profile than its peers, including <span class="companylink">Micron Technology Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), which is more cyclical and capital intensive but also more conservatively capitalized. Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductor N.V</span>. (BBB-/Positive), <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> has greater financial flexibility and stronger profitability, although NXP's Outlook reflects expectations for comparatively conservative financial policies. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> benefits from greater financial flexibility and market share leadership than <span class="companylink">Marvell Technology Group Ltd</span>. (BBB-/Positive), but Fitch expects Marvell will maintain more conservative financial policies over the intermediate term while focused on organic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> is down by mid-single digits overall in fiscal 2020 with meaningfully steeper negative organic growth in consumer markets, and partially mitigated by subscription revenue in the company infrastructure software and services businesses' (roughly one-third of revenue when layering in a full year of <span class="companylink">Symantec</span>);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low growth through the remainder of the forecast period with some inorganic growth in fiscal 2022 that bleeds into 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profit margins expand slightly, driven by expectations for lower consumer contribution (lower margins) and a higher mix of software revenue. Operating leverage will be less of a headwind since its only internalized manufacturing is in radio frequency filters for wireless handsets, which Fitch expects to decline significantly as a percentage of the overall sales mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends scale to equal 50% of pre-dividend FCF and no stock buybacks until fiscal 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest acquisitions aside from another $10 billion deal in fiscal 2022, which the company will fund half with cash flow and half with preferred equity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Use of FCF for debt reduction through fiscal 2021, since lower near-term profitability constrains the company's ability to de-lever as expected in fiscal 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will maintain total debt to FCF closer to 5x and total debt to operating EBITDA 3x, from a combination of debt reduction and profitability growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBIT-margin expansion from successfully achieving $2.5 billion of operating income on $3.5 billion of annual revenue for CA and realizing close to $1 billion of synergies for <span class="companylink">Symantec</span>'s enterprise business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt/FCF in excess of 8.0x or total leverage above 3.0x driven by acquisitions without sufficient profitability or subsequent debt reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for negative organic revenue growth or market share losses particularly in radio frequency for wireless, likely from overly aggressive cuts to R&D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s liquidity is adequate, and as of Feb. 2, 2020 was supported by: i) $6.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and ii) an undrawn $5 billion five-year RCF, which more than fully back-stops the $2 billion CP program. Fitch's expectation for $4 billion to $5 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity. In line with the company's guidance, Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> will use FCF and excess cash for debt reduction rather than share repurchases. Aside from modest mandatory amortization under <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span>'s $16.6 billion of term loans, <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> faces $4.75 billion of debt maturities over the near-term, including:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$2 billion of borrowings outstanding under the CP program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$750 million of 2.2% senior notes due Jan. 15, 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$2 billion of 3.13% due April 15, 2021.</p>

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>
