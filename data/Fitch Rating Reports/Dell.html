<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-01 May 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2025-1 (DEFT 2025-1). The transaction is a securitization of equipment-backed receivables originated by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services LLC</span> (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2025-1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; New Rating; F1+sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-3 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----B ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----C ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; Asf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; BBBsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance — Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2025-1 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) rated obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is 'A-'/'BBB+', stronger than the WA rating of 'BBB'/'BBB-' in DEFT 2024-2. The number of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2025-1 remains a sizable portion of the pool, but these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk — Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top 10 obligors, and the top 20 obligors represent 4.97%, 32.12%, and 44.71% of DEFT 2025-1, up modestly from 4.91%, 30.16%, and 42.52% of DEFT 2024-2, respectively. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly thereafter and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, seven of the top 10 obligors are IG entities, in line with recent DEFT transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Rating-Case Loss Proxy — Normalizing Asset Performance: DFS-owned portfolio loss performance in the small and medium-sized business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in late 2020 and early 2021. Default rates have been low in the public and large institution (PLI) segment due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >All DFS-sponsored securitizations exhibited low cumulative net losses (CNLs), while the performance of DEFT transactions between 2022 and 2023 has continued to normalize, compared with the strong performance observed during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating case CNL proxy for DEFT 2025-1 is 1.30%, down from 1.45% in DEFT 2024-2. However, the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach due to the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and its shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis — Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): All classes benefit from a non-declining cash reserve account funded at 1.00% of the initial discounted pool balance and initial overcollateralization (OC) equal to 4.30% of the discounted pool balance. Total initial hard CE for the class A, B, C, and D notes is 12.40%, 10.80%, 8.60%, and 5.30%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While CE levels for classes A and D are lower than in DEFT 2024-2, classes B and C have had increases. Specifically, the CE for class B increased to 10.80% from 10.58%, and for class C, it rose to 8.60% from 8.18%. Conversely, CE for class A decreased to 12.40% from 12.58%, and for class D, it dropped to 5.30% from 5.58%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additionally, all classes benefit from 3.05% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six, and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk — Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: DFS has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its owned and managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case CNL expectation, which does not include a margin of safety and is not used in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s quantitative analysis to assign ratings, is 0.70%. This is based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s economic outlook and managed pool and historical securitization performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the rating case CNL proxy and would likely result in declines of CE and the remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. In addition, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to 12 from eight. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the ratings of the DEFT 2025-1 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative as it does not take into consideration the CE build as the transaction de-levers. Downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial rating case CNL proxy and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the rating case CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. In addition, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the rating case CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2025-1 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance, driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles than in the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span>. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on the comparison and recomputation of certain information with respect to 175 contracts from the preliminary collateral pool of assets in connection with DEFT 2025-1. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considered this information in its analysis, and it did not have an effect on our analysis or conclusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by clicking the link to the Appendix. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-21 April 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> expects to assign ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2025-1 (DEFT 2025-1). The transaction is a securitization of equipment-backed receivables originated by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services LLC</span> (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2025-1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; Expected Rating; F1+(EXP)sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-3 ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; BBB(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance — Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2025-1 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) rated obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is 'A-'/'BBB+', stronger than the WA rating of 'BBB'/'BBB-' in DEFT 2024-2. The number of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2025-1 remains a sizable portion of the pool, but these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk — Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top 10 obligors and the top 20 obligors represent 4.97%, 32.12% and 44.71% of DEFT 2025-1, up modestly from 4.91%, 30.16% and 42.52% of DEFT 2024-2, respectively. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly thereafter and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, seven of the top 10 obligors are IG entities, in line with recent DEFT transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Rating-Case Loss Proxy — Normalizing Asset Performance: DFS-owned portfolio loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in late 2020 and early 2021. Default rates have been low in the public and large institution (PLI) segment due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >All DFS-sponsored securitizations exhibited low cumulative net losses (CNLs), while the performance of DEFT transactions between 2022 and 2023 has continued to normalize, compared with the strong performance observed during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating case CNL proxy for DEFT 2025-1 is 1.30%, down from 1.45% in DEFT 2024-2. However, the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach due to the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis — Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): All classes benefit from a non-declining cash reserve account funded at 1.00% of the initial discounted pool balance and initial overcollateralization (OC) equal to 4.30% of the discounted pool balance. Total initial hard CE for the class A, B, C and D notes is 12.40%, 10.80%, 8.60% and 5.30%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While CE levels for classes A and D are lower than in DEFT 2024-2, classes B and C have seen increases. Specifically, the CE for class B has increased to 10.80% from 10.58%, and for class C, it has risen to 8.60% from 8.18%. Conversely, CE for class A has decreased to 12.40% from 12.58%, and for class D, it has dropped to 5.30% from 5.58%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additionally, all classes benefit from 2.52% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk — Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: DFS has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its owned and managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case CNL expectation, which does not include a margin of safety and is not used in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s quantitative analysis to assign ratings, is 0.70%. This is based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s economic outlook and managed pool and historical securitization performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the rating case CNL proxy and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. In addition, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to 12 from eight. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the ratings of the DEFT 2025-1 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative as it does not take into consideration the CE build as the transaction de-levers. Downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial rating case CNL proxy and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the rating case CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. In addition, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the rating case CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2025-1 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span>. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on the comparison and recomputation of certain information with respect to 175 contracts from the preliminary collateral pool of assets in connection with DEFT 2025-1. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considered this information in its analysis, and it did not have an effect on our analysis or conclusions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-26 March 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB' rating to <b>Dell</b> International L.L.C.'s (<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>) and <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span>'s new 3-, 5,-, 7- and 10-year unsecured issuances. The company will use the offering's net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PC Market Leader: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates the mature personal computer (PC) market will continue to experience cyclical growth fluctuations aligned with GDP over the long term. <b>Dell</b>'s Client Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">CSG</span>) comprises about half of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s sales. <span class="companylink">CSG</span> is positioned to benefit from tailwinds in AI-related performance demands, PC refresh cycles, and the growth of hybrid working environments, which could boost demand for monitors and peripherals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positioned for AI Growth: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a market leader in servers and multiple storage categories, showing adaptability despite competition from cloud solutions. The Infrastructure Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">ISG</span>) segment is well-positioned to benefit from demand for both traditional and more expensive AI servers. Generative AI and the potential for increased data growth are tailwinds for the ISG segment, which could enhance <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s assessment of the industry's growth potential if they materialize over time. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s full product portfolio and services support its competitive positioning, including within the growing AI hardware market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Declining Core Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> uses core EBITDA leverage in its assessment of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, excluding the estimated contribution of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services</span> (DFS). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> to maintain leverage below the upgrade sensitivity of 2.0x over the rating horizon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capacity for Shareholder Returns from High FCF: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast average pre-dividend annual FCF of around $4 billion to $5 billion annually through the rating horizon provides capacity for continued post-shareholder return debt reductions. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial policy allocates more than 80% of FCF to shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. The remaining FCF goes toward M&A and leverage activities. Since the majority of shareholder returns typically are from discretionary share buybacks, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> has the flexibility to adjust distribution levels during years of weaker FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Focus on Smaller M&A: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s M&A strategy focuses on tuck-in acquisitions that enhance its intellectual property or strengthen its position in strategic markets like AI. An improving trend in <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial structure provides some ratings headroom for potential M&A involving debt financing. Consistent with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s tuck-in acquisition strategy and the expectation that any smaller strategic acquisitions would have a lag before meaningfully affecting top-line growth, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not attribute material M&A contributions to revenue during its forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent and Subsidiary IDRs Equalized: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizes the Issuer-Default Ratings (IDRs) of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies Inc</span> (BBB/F2/Positive), the public holding company and its wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are issuers of debt (<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Inc.</span>, <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span>). Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Criteria, this follows the stronger subsidiary and weaker parent relationship, with the consolidated credit profile reflecting both open access and control, as well as the absence of legal ring fencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (<span class="companylink">HPE</span>; BBB+/Stable) has more software content and models, which are relatively higher margin compared to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s product portfolio, and has historically had a more conservative financial structure. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> aims to distribute over 80% FCF, compared to <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s 60%, which is expected to decrease if <span class="companylink">HPE</span> closes its <span class="companylink">Juniper Networks Inc.</span> acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">HP Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">HP</span>; BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s business profile benefits from its exposure to the server and storage market. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile is stronger than <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s, with higher FCF margins and a historically more conservative financial structure. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s shareholder return policy is more aggressive than <span class="companylink">HPE</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, with a plan to return approximately 100% of FCF to shareholders while under 2.0x gross leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual forecast revenue modestly up sequentially, supported by the expectation improvement in enterprise demand and refresh cycle. Revenue during the latter half of forecast is expected to see mid-single-digit growth in <span class="companylink">ISG</span> as AI-related demand continues, as well as mid- to low-single-digit growth in <span class="companylink">CSG</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Modest EBITDA margin increases during the forecast period, supported by a focus on cost controls and expense control actions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Steady capex of 2.5%-3.0% of revenue, consistent with historic annual levels;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Minimum 80% of FCF used for shareholder returns. Per share dividends grow 10% annually, in line with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial policy;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capitalization (debt/equity) attributable to <span class="companylink">DFS</span> and related to core leverage calculation steady at 4.0x through the forecast period. An adjustment is made to sustain an allowable leverage level at a standalone DFS, based on input from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Non-Bank Financial Institutions group;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base interest rates applicable to the company's RCF obligations reflects current secured overnight financing rate forward curve. No facility draws are forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market share losses in <span class="companylink">CSG</span> and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Core EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.5x and adjusted FCF to core debt, with volatility, averaging below 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from higher EBITDA market-share gains in <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Core EBITDA leverage sustained below 2.0x and low volatility of adjusted FCF to core debt, sustained near</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the end of fiscal 2025, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity consisted of approximately $3.6 billion of readily available cash and an undrawn $6.0 billion RCF maturing November 2027. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revolving facilities also support a $5 billion unused CP program. Forecast post-dividend FCF further support <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity and reduce refinancing risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s next notable senior unsecured maturity period is in its fiscal 2027 when $4.25 billion of notes mature. Excluding the current issue, maturities of approximately $10 billion of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s outstanding unsecured notes are staggered between 2029 and 2051.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning traditional and emerging, multicloud technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> deconsolidates, including a profitability estimate and debt proxy related to <span class="companylink">DFS</span>, financing activities to calculate core EBITDA and core debt for core leverage for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc.</span> A maximum allowable debt to equity ratio for the financing business of 4:1 is applied and an adjustment to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s debt level to maintain this is made.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-16 October 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2024-2 (DEFT 2024-2). The transaction is a securitization of equipment-backed receivables originated by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services LLC</span> (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >DEFT 2024-2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; New Rating; F1+sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-3 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----B ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----C ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; Asf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; BBBsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance — Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2024-2 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) rated obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is 'BBB'/'BBB-', the lowest amount among recent transactions, driven by an increase in 'BBB' rated top obligors. Although the amount of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2024-2 is lower than in recent transactions, they remain a sizable portion of the pool. These obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk — Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top 10 obligors and the top 20 obligors represent 4.91%, 30.16% and 42.52% of DEFT 2024-2, respectively. These levels are lower than DEFT 2024-1, and more in line with DEFT 2023-3. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional, small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, eight of the top 10 obligors are IG entities, compared to five IG obligors among the top 10 in DEFT 2024-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Rating Case Loss Proxy — Resilient but Normalizing Asset Performance: DFS-owned portfolio loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations showed low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has been normalizing more quickly compared with the strength shown during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating case CNL proxy for DEFT 2024-2 is 1.45%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis — Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): All classes benefit from a non-declining cash reserve account funded at 1.08% of the initial discounted pool balance and initial overcollateralization (OC) equal to 4.50% of the discounted pool balance. Total initial hard CE for the class A, B, C and D notes is 12.58%, 10.58%, 8.18% and 5.58%, respectively. The initial hard CE levels for DEFT 2024-2 are lower than DEFT 2024-1 but in line with other recent DEFT transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, all classes benefit from 2.59% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk — Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: <span class="companylink">DFS</span> has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its owned and managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case CNL expectation, which does not include a margin of safety and is not used in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s quantitative analysis to assign ratings, is 0.80%. This is based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s economic outlook and forecast projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the rating case CNL proxy, and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. In addition, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to 15 from seven. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario, and the ratings of the DEFT 2024-2 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative as it does not take into consideration the CE build as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial rating case CNL proxy and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the rating case CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. In addition, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the rating case CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2024-2 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span> . The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on the comparison and recomputation of certain information with respect to 175 contracts from the preliminary collateral pool of assets in connection with DEFT 2024-2. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis or conclusions.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-07 October 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Short-Term IDRs of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>), <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span> at 'BBB' and 'F2'. <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span>'s senior unsecured ratings and short-term CP ratings are affirmed at 'BBB' and 'F2'. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Inc</span>'s IDR is affirmed at 'BBB' and its senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s rating is informed by its leading market positions, demand pipeline in its server and storage lines, and its liquidity position. It also considers <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s competitive industry profile and the potential impact on performance from macroeconomic headwinds. The Positive Outlook reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s core EBITDA leverage that is below 2.0x, its position to benefit from increased AI hardware spending, and potential EBITDA margin improvements in its ISG segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Declining Core Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> utilizes core EBITDA leverage, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s calculation that excludes the estimated contribution of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services</span> (DFS), as part of its assessment of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>. Core leverage for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s latest fiscal year ended Feb. 2, 2024 was 1.7x, modestly below the upgrade sensitivity of 2.0x. We expect this to be about 1.6x at fiscal YE 2025. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s Positive Outlook is supported by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that core leverage will continue to decrease with EBITDA improvements and be maintained around 1.5x during the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PC Market Leader: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that the mature PC market will continue to experience cyclical growth fluctuations aligned with GDP over the long term. <b>Dell</b>'s Client Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">CSG</span>) makes up about half of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s sales, and a percentage of sales mix is down through 1H25 due to the relative performance of its Infrastructure Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">ISG</span>). <span class="companylink">CSG</span> is positioned to benefit from tailwinds in artificial intelligence (AI) related performance demands, a refresh cycles of PCs and the growth of hybrid working environments, which could boost demand for monitors and peripherals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positioned for AI Growth: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a market leader in servers and multiple storage categories, showing adaptability despite competition from cloud solutions. The <span class="companylink">ISG</span> is well-positioned to benefit from demand for both traditional and more expensive AI servers, as results through <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s 1H25 have demonstrated. Generative AI and potential for increased data growth present a tailwind for the ISG segment, which could enhance <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s assessment of the industry's growth potential if they materialize over time. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s full product portfolio and services support its competitive positioning, including within the growing AI hardware market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capacity for High FCF Returns to Shareholders: Forecast average pre-dividend annual FCF of around $4 billion to $5 billion annually through the rating horizon provides capacity for continued post-shareholder return debt reductions. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial policy prioritizes more than 80% of FCF to shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. The remaining FCF goes toward M&A and leverage activities. Since the majority of shareholder returns typically come from discretionary share buybacks, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> has the flexibility to adjust distribution levels during years of weaker FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> increased its dividend 20% at the beginning of fiscal 2025, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expects the less flexible dividends to be broadly around only 30% of pre-dividend FCF during its forecast. Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is expected to exceed its 80% minimum return target while maintaining its credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Smaller M&A: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s M&A strategy focuses on tuck-in acquisitions that add to its intellectual property or increases its position in strategic markets, such as AI. An improving trend in <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial structure provides some ratings headroom for potential M&A that uses a debt finance component. Consistent with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s tuck-in acquisition signaling and the expectation that any smaller strategic acquisitions would have a lag period before meaningfully affecting top-line growth, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not attribute material M&A contributions to revenue during its forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent and Subsidiary IDRs Equalized: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizes the IDRs of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, the public holding company, and its wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are issuers of debt (<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Inc.</span>, <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span>). Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Criteria," this follows the stronger subsidiary/weaker parent relationship with the consolidated credit profile reflecting both open access and control, as well as the absence of legal ring fencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Inc.</span>'s senior unsecured notes, which represent approximately $1 billion of debt, are rated one notch below its IDR due to the structural subordination of these notes, which are not guaranteed by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, <b>Dell</b> International or <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span>'s (HPE; BBB+/Stable) financial structure has traditionally been more conservative than <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s core EBITDA level which has been a relative credit profile difference with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, net of its planned Juniper acquisition, to be 1.1x at fiscal 2024 (ending Oct. 31, 2024), However, <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s EBITDA should increase meaningfully above <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s level to about 3x pro forma <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s Juniper transaction. The difference is expected to normalize over the next two years as <span class="companylink">HPE</span> reduces net leverage toward its target of 2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >There are modest differences in financial policies between the companies, with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> targeting an 80% distribution of FCF compared to <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s 60%. <span class="companylink">HPE</span> believes M&A is a core component of its expected growth, while <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> targets smaller, strategic value tuck-in acquisitions. <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s profitability benefits from a higher EBITDA margin than <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, partly due to <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s higher margin software exposure. In contrast, about half of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s sales mix comes from relatively lower-margin PC and peripherals sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">HP Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">HP</span>; BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s industry profile sector-specific key factor rating assigned in our ratings navigator is two notches higher at 'bbb-'. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s business profile benefits from its exposure to the server and storage market. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile is stronger than <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s, with higher FCF margins and a historically more conservative financial structure. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has the most aggressive shareholder return policy, compared with <span class="companylink">HPE</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, with a plan to return approximately 100% of FCF to shareholders while under 2.0x gross leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">ISG</span> revenue improves in fiscal 2025 yoy about 27% and <span class="companylink">CSG</span> in fiscal 2025 yoy is about flat informed by 1H25 results, guidance and the expectation for continued server demand momentum;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fiscal 2026 forecast revenue modestly up sequentially, directionally consistent with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Global Economic Outlook - September 2024," supported by the expectation improvement in enterprise demand and eventual refresh cycle. Revenue during the latter half of forecast is expected to see midsingle-digit growth in <span class="companylink">ISG</span> as AI-related demand continues, as well as mid- to low single-digit growth in <span class="companylink">CSG</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An EBITDA margin of approximately 10% is expected for fiscal 2025, informed by actual fiscal 1H25 results. Modest margin increases during the forecast period supported by a focus on cost controls and expense control actions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Steady capex of 2.5%-3.0% of revenue, consistent with historic annual levels;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Minimum 80% of FCF utilized for shareholder returns. Per share dividends grow 10% annually, in line with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial policy;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capitalization (debt/equity) attributable to <span class="companylink">DFS</span> and related to core leverage calculation steady at 4.0x through forecast period. A capital injection from cash on hand is made to <span class="companylink">DFS</span> to sustain an allowable leverage level from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Non-Bank Financial Institutions group;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base interest rates applicable to the company's revolving credit facility obligations reflects current secured overnight financing rate forward curve declining to 2.8% from 5.0% during the forecast period. No facility draws are forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could stabilize the Outlook for the 'BBB' ratings if we expect core leverage to be sustained above 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from higher EBITDA market-share gains in <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Core EBITDA leverage sustained below 2.0x and low volatility of adjusted FCF to core debt, sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market share losses in <span class="companylink">CSG</span> and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Core EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.5x adjusted and adjusted FCF to core debt with volatility averaging below 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash in Excess of Operational Needs: At 2Q fiscal 2025 <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity position consisted of approximately $4.56 billion of readily available cash and an undrawn $6.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing November 2027. Excluding <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revolving facilities, which also support a $5 billion unused commercial paper program, this level of cash provides a healthy buffer to support cyclical needs in excess of a $4 billion to $5 billion level of cash that <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> management estimates it requires on hand to operate its business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forecast post-dividend FCF between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028 of approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion annually further support <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity and reduce refinancing risk. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s next notable maturity period is in its fiscal 2027 when $4.25 billion of senior unsecured notes, which <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> cut by $1 billion during fiscal 2024, matures. Approximately $10 billion of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s outstanding unsecured notes mature at staggered dates between 2029 and 2051.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning traditional and emerging, multicloud technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> deconsolidates a profitability estimate and debt proxy related to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services</span> (DFS) financing activities to calculate core EBITDA and core debt for core leverage for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc.</span> A maximum allowable debt to equity ratio for the financing business of 4:1 is applied.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Governance Structure as Michael <b>Dell</b> is a controlling shareholder of the company's common stock and there exists key man risk.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-03 October 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> expects to assign ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2024-2 (DEFT 2024-2). The transaction is a securitization of equipment-backed receivables originated by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services LLC</span> (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2024-2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; Expected Rating; F1+(EXP)sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; BBB(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance — Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2024-2 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) rated obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is 'BBB'/'BBB-', the lowest amount among recent transactions, driven by an increase in 'BBB' rated top obligors. Although the amount of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2024-2 is lower than in recent transactions, they remain a sizable portion of the pool. These obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk — Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top 10 obligors and the top 20 obligors represent 4.91%, 30.16% and 42.52% of DEFT 2024-2, respectively. These levels are lower than DEFT 2024-1, and more in line with DEFT 2023-3. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional, small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, eight of the top 10 obligors are IG entities, compared to five IG obligors among the top 10 in DEFT 2024-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Rating Case Loss Proxy — Resilient but Normalizing Asset Performance: DFS-owned portfolio loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations showed low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has been normalizing more quickly compared with the strength shown during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating case CNL proxy for DEFT 2024-2 is 1.45%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis — Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): All classes benefit from a non-declining cash reserve account funded at 1.00% of the initial discounted pool balance and initial overcollateralization (OC) equal to 4.50% of the discounted pool balance. Total initial hard CE for the class A, B, C and D notes is 12.50%, 10.50%, 8.10% and 5.50%, respectively. The initial hard CE levels for DEFT 2024-2 are lower than DEFT 2024-1 but in line with other recent DEFT transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, all classes benefit from 2.65% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk — Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: <span class="companylink">DFS</span> has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its owned and managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case CNL expectation, which does not include a margin of safety and is not used in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s quantitative analysis to assign ratings, is 0.80%. This is based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s economic outlook and forecast projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the rating case CNL proxy, and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. In addition, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to 15 from seven. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the ratings of the DEFT 2024-2 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative as it does not take into consideration the CE build as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial rating case CNL proxy and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the rating case CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. In addition, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the rating case CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2024-2 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span>. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on the comparison and recomputation of certain information with respect to 175 contracts from the preliminary collateral pool of assets in connection with DEFT 2024-2. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect on our analysis or conclusions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-01 October 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB' rating to <b>Dell</b> International L.L.C.'s and <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span>'s (as co-issuers) new unsecured issuances maturing 2030 and 2035. The company will use the offering's proceeds to redeem the $1 billion outstanding 5.85% notes maturing July, 2025. They will issue a redemption notice at the same times as the offering. Any excess amounts will go toward general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PC and Server Market Leader: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that the mature PC market will continue to experience cyclical growth fluctuations aligned with GDP over the long term. <b>Dell</b>'s Client Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">CSG</span>) makes up about half of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s sales and a percentage of sales mix is down through 1H25 due to the relative performance of its Infrastructure Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">ISG</span>). <span class="companylink">CSG</span> is positioned to benefit from tailwinds in artificial intelligence (AI) related performance demands, a refresh cycles of PCs, and the growth of hybrid working environments, which could boost demand for monitors and peripherals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a market leader in servers with top positions in multiple storage categories. Its <span class="companylink">ISG</span> and related data center spending has shown adaptability and resilience, even as alternative technologies, such as competitor cloud solutions offer alternatives. The <span class="companylink">ISG</span> is well-positioned to benefit from current demand for both traditional and AI servers. Generative AI and potential for increased data growth present a tailwind for the ISG segment, which could enhance <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s assessment of the industry's growth potential if these benefits materialize over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Core Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> utilizes core EBITDA leverage, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s calculation of which excludes the estimated contribution of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services</span> (DFS), as part of its assessment of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>. Core leverage for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s latest fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 was 1.7x, modestly below the upgrade sensitivity of 2.0x. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects core leverage to further decrease toward 1.5x during the forecast period as EBITDA improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capacity for High FCF Returns to Shareholders: Forecast average pre-dividend annual FCF of around $4 billion to $5 billion annually through the rating horizon provides capacity for continued post-shareholder return debt reductions. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial policy prioritizes more than 80% of FCF to shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. The remaining FCF goes towards M&A and leverage activities. Since the majority of shareholder returns typically come from discretionary share buy backs, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> has the flexibility to adjust distribution levels during years of weaker FCF. Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is expected to exceed the 80% minimum return target while maintaining its credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Smaller M&A: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s M&A strategy focuses on tuck-in acquisitions that add to its intellectual property or increases its position in strategic markets, such as AI. An improving trend in <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial structure provides some ratings headroom for potential M&A that uses a debt finance component. Consistent with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s tuck-in acquisition signaling and the expectation that any smaller strategic acquisitions would have a lag period before meaningfully affecting top-line growth, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not attribute material M&A contributions to revenue during its forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary IDRs Equalized: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> equalizes the IDR's of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc.</span>, the public holding company, and its wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that issue debt: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Inc.</span>, <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corporation</span>. Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Criteria" this follows the stronger subsidiary weaker parent relationship with the consolidated credit profile reflecting both open access and control, as well as the absence of legal ring fencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span>'s (HPE; BBB+/Stable) financial structure has traditionally been more conservative than <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s core EBITDA level--which has been a relative credit profile difference with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>--net of its planned Juniper acquisition, to be 1.1x at fiscal 2024 (ending Oct. 31, 2024), However, <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s EBITDA should increase meaningfully above <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s level, to about 3x proforma <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s Juniper transaction. The difference is expected to normalize over the next two years as <span class="companylink">HPE</span> reduces net leverage towards its target of 2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >There are modest differences in financial policies between the companies, with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> targeting an 80% distribution of FCF, compared to <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s 60%. <span class="companylink">HPE</span> believes M&A is a core component of its expected growth, while <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> targets smaller, strategic value tuck-in acquisitions. <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s profitability benefits from a higher EBITDA margin than <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, partly due to <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s higher margin software exposure. In contrast, about half of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s sales mix comes from relatively lower-margin PC and peripherals sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">HP Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">HP</span>; BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s industry profile sector-specific key factor rating assigned in our ratings navigator is two notches higher at 'bbb-'. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s business profile benefits from its exposure to the server and storage market. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business. <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile is stronger than <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s, with higher FCF margins and a historically more conservative financial structure. <span class="companylink">HP</span> has the most aggressive shareholder return policy, compared with <span class="companylink">HPE</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, with a plan to return approximately 100% of FCF to shareholders while under 2.0x gross leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">CSG</span> revenues improve in fiscal 2025 yoy about 27% and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> in fiscal 2025 yoy is about flat informed by 1H25 results, guidance and the expectation for continued server demand momentum;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fiscal 2026 forecast revenues modestly up sequentially, directionally consistent with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Global Economic Outlook - September 2024, supported by the expectation improvement in enterprise demand and eventual refresh cycle. Revenues during the latter half of forecast are expected to see mid-single-digit growth in <span class="companylink">ISG</span> as AI related demand continues, as well as mid to low-single-digit growth in <span class="companylink">CSG</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Steady capex of 2.5%-3.0% of revenue, consistent with historic annual levels;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Minimum 80% of FCF utilized for shareholder returns. Per share dividends grow 10% annually, in line with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial policy;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capitalization (debt/equity) attributable to <span class="companylink">DFS</span> and related to core leverage calculation steady at 4.0x through forecast period. A capital injection from cash on hand is made to <span class="companylink">DFS</span> to sustain an allowable leverage level from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Non-Bank Financial Institutions group;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base interest rates applicable to the company's revolving credit facility obligations reflects current secured overnight financing rate forward curve declining from 5.00% to 2.8% during the forecast period. No facility draws are forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from profitable market-share gains in <span class="companylink">CSG</span> and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Core EBITDA leverage sustained below 2.0x and adjusted FCF to core debt sustained near 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market-share losses in <span class="companylink">CSG</span> and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Core EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.5x adjusted and adjusted FCF to core debt sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash in Excess of Operational Needs: At 2Q fiscal 2025 <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity position consisted of approximately $4.56 billion of readily available cash and an undrawn $6.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing November 2027. Excluding <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revolving facilities, which also support a $5 billion unused commercial paper program, this level of cash provides a healthy buffer to support cyclical needs in excess of a $4 billion to $5 billion level of cash that <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> management estimates it requires on hand to operate its business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider, with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning both traditional and emerging, multi-cloud technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> deconsolidates a profitability estimate and debt proxy related to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services</span> (DFS) financing activities to calculate Core EBITDA and Core debt for Core Leverage for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc.</span> A maximum allowable debt to equity ratio for the financing business of 4:1 is applied.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-17 April 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2024-1 (DEFT 2024-1). The transaction is a securitization of equipment receivables originated by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services L.L.C.</span> (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2024-1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; New Rating; F1+sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-3 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----B ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----C ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; Asf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; BBBsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance — Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2024-1 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is about 'BBB+'/'A-', consistent with DEFT 2023-3. Although the amount of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2024-1 is lower than in recent transactions, there remains a sizable portion in the pool; however, these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk — Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top 10 obligors and the top 20 obligors represent 4.72%, 31.75% and 45.71% of DEFT 2024-1, respectively. These levels are higher than DEFT 2023-3 but more in line with DEFT 2023-2. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, the top 10 obligors are mostly IG entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Rating Case Loss Proxy — Strong but Normalizing Asset Performance: DFS-owned portfolio loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness observed in late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations showed low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has shown a normalizing trend compared with the strength shown through the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating case CNL proxy for DEFT 2024-1 is 1.20%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis — Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Total initial hard CE for the class A, B, C and D notes is 13.65%, 12.60%, 10.35% and 7.40%, respectively. The initial hard CE levels for DEFT 2024-1 are higher than DEFT 2023-3 but similar to DEFT 2023-2. The DEFT 2024-1 class A, B, and C notes benefit from subordination of 6.25%, 5.20% and 2.95%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additionally, all classes benefit from a non-declining cash reserve account funded at 1.00% of the initial discounted pool balance and initial overcollateralization (OC) equal to 6.40% of the discounted pool balance. All classes also benefit from 2.48% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk — Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: DFS has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its owned and managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case CNL expectation, which does not include a margin of safety and is not used in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s quantitative analysis to assign ratings, is 0.70%. This is based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s economic outlook and forecasted projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the rating case CNL proxy and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. Additionally, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to nine from one. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared with the primary scenario and the ratings to the DEFT 2024-1 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative, as it does not take into consideration the CE build as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial rating case CNL proxy and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the rating case CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the rating case CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2024-1 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span>. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on the comparison and recomputation of certain information with respect to 175 contracts from the preliminary collateral pool of assets in connection with DEFT 2024-1. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis or conclusions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-03 April 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> expects to assign ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2024-1 (DEFT 2024-1). The transaction is a securitization of equipment backed receivables originated by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services L.L.C.</span> (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2024-1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; Expected Rating; F1+(EXP)sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; BBB(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance — Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2024-1 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is about 'BBB+'/'A-', consistent with DEFT 2023-3. Although the amount of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2024-1 is lower than in recent transactions, there remains a sizable portion in the pool; however, these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk — Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top 10 obligors and the top 20 obligors represent 4.72%, 31.75% and 45.71% of DEFT 2024-1, respectively. These levels are higher than DEFT 2023-3 but more in line with DEFT 2023-2. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, the top 10 obligors are mostly IG entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Rating Case Loss Proxy — Strong but Normalizing Asset Performance: DFS-owned portfolio loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness observed in late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations showed low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has shown a normalizing trend compared with the strength shown through the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating case CNL proxy for DEFT 2024-1 is 1.20%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis — Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Total initial hard CE for the class A, B, C and D notes is 13.65%, 12.60%, 10.35% and 7.40%, respectively. The initial hard CE levels for DEFT 2024-1 are higher than DEFT 2023-3 but similar to DEFT 2023-2. The DEFT 2024-1 class A, B, and C notes benefit from subordination of 6.25%, 5.20% and 2.95%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additionally, all classes benefit from a non-declining cash reserve account funded at 1.00% of the initial discounted pool balance and initial overcollateralization (OC) equal to 6.40% of the discounted pool balance. All classes also benefit from 2.27% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk — Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: DFS has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its owned and managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case CNL expectation, which does not include a margin of safety and is not used in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s quantitative analysis to assign ratings, is 0.70%. This is based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s economic outlook and forecasted projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the rating case CNL proxy and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. Additionally, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to nine from one. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared with the primary scenario and the ratings to the DEFT 2024-1 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative, as it does not take into consideration the CE build as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial rating case CNL proxy and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the rating case CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the rating case CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2024-1 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span>. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on the comparison and recomputation of certain information with respect to 175 contracts from the preliminary collateral pool of assets in connection with DEFT 2024-1. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis or conclusions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago/Toronto-04 December 2023: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies Inc</span>?s credit profile benefits from the announced cash tender, but its Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and Short-Term IDRs of 'BBB' and 'F2', respectively, are unaffected by it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Dec. 4 <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> announced a cash tender for up to $500 million in aggregate debt prioritized over seven senior unsecured debt issuances. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the gross debt reduction favorably. The bottom line impact is likely to be modestly tempered by the relatively lower coupon rate of the higher acceptance priority targeted issues, which benefits leverage but has a smaller impact on interest coverage. After taking account of an assumed successful $500 million gross debt reduction, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts core EBITDA leverage to be approximately 1.8x at fiscal YE 2024. Although this transaction supports reducing leverage toward <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s 1.5x core leverage long-term target, it is not enough to affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This tender follows $2.2 billion of senior unsecured debt reductions made during the first six months of fiscal 2024 completed through a combination of an approximately $1 billion debt tender, $1 billion of maturing debt repaid with cash and opportunistic open market operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s rating reflects its leading market positions, improving core EBITDA leverage below 2.0x that has benefitted from gross debt reduction actions, and <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity position. It also considers <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s competitive industry profile, current consumer and enterprise spending restraint, as well as potential macroeconomic headwinds.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-Toronto-25 October 2023: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) and Short-Term IDRs of <b>Dell</b> Technologies Inc. (<b>Dell</b>), <b>Dell</b> International LLC and EMC Corporation at 'BBB', and 'F2'. <b>Dell</b> International LLC and EMC Corporation's senior unsecured ratings and short-term CP ratings are affirmed at 'BBB' and 'F2'. <b>Dell</b> Inc's IDR is affirmed at 'BBB' and its senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b>'s rating reflects its leading market positions, improving core EBITDA leverage below 2.0x that has benefitted from gross debt reduction actions, and <b>Dell</b>'s liquidity position. It also considers <b>Dell</b>'s competitive industry profile, current consumer and enterprise spending restraint, as well as potential macroeconomic headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PC and Server Market Leader: The PC market is largely mature and Fitch anticipates related revenues, which have returned down to pre-pandemic levels, to continue to be affected by consumer and enterprise spending restraint, as well as pandemic demand pull through in the short term. Over the longer-term, Fitch anticipates market growth to continue to be cyclically affected and to broadly fluctuate with economic demand aligned with GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b>'s Client Solutions Group (CSG), which comprises around 57% of the company's sales mix, is positioned to benefit from tailwinds in artificial intelligence should that accelerate refresh cycles of PC's, as well as longer term hybrid working environments that <b>Dell</b>'s market position in monitors and its peripherals growth emphasis could benefit from. Profitability within CSG has benefited from an increase in sales mix to more profitable commercial sales, which contributed over 80% of segment sales in the first half of fiscal 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> is the market leader in servers and has leading positions in multiple storage categories. Its Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) and related data center spending has proven adaptable and resilient as alternative technologies such as competitor cloud solutions provide substitution options. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the related potential increase for data growth requirements provides a tailwind for the ISG segment that could improve Fitch's assessment of the industry's growth potential if these benefits are demonstrated over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Core Leverage: Fitch utilizes core EBITDA leverage, which excludes the estimated contribution of <b>Dell</b> Financial Services (DFS), as part of its assessment of <b>Dell</b>. Core leverage is forecast to be 1.9x at fiscal YE 2024, modestly below the upgrade sensitivity of 2.0x and Fitch expects it to further decrease during the forecast period as EBITDA improves, trending towards <b>Dell</b>'s 1.5x core leverage long-term target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Discretionary Debt Reductions: During the first six months of fiscal 2024, leverage benefitted from approximately $2.2 billion in senior unsecured debt reductions completed through a combination of an approximately $1 billion debt tender, $1 billion of maturing debt repaid with cash and opportunistic open market operations. The open market bond repurchases targeted lower coupon 2041 and 2051 senior unsecured bond issues, which benefits leverage, but has a smaller impact on interest coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forecast average pre-dividend annual FCF in excess of $5 billion thorough the rating horizon provides capacity for continued post shareholder return debt reductions. <b>Dell</b>'s financial policy prioritizes 80%+ of FCF to shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases, with M&A and leverage activities allocated the remaining FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Smaller M&A: <b>Dell</b>'s M&A strategy is focused on tuck-in acquisitions that add to its intellectual property or increase their position in strategic markets such as AI. An improving trend in <b>Dell</b>'s financial structure provides some ratings headroom for potential M&A that uses a debt finance component. Consistent with <b>Dell</b>'s tuck in acquisition signaling, as well as the expectation that any smaller strategic acquisitions would have a lag period before meaningfully impacting top line growth, Fitch does not attribute material M&A contributions to revenue during its forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary IDR's Equalized: Fitch equalizes the IDR's of <b>Dell</b>, the public holding company, and its wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are issuers of debt, <b>Dell</b> Inc., <b>Dell</b> International LLC and EMC Corporation. Under Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Criteria this follows the stronger subsidiary weaker parent relationship with the consolidated credit profile reflecting both open access and control, as well as the absence of legal ring fencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Inc's senior unsecured notes, which represent approximately $1 billion of debt, are rated one notch below its IDR due to the structural subordination of these notes, which are not guaranteed by <b>Dell</b>, <b>Dell</b> International or EMC Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b>'s financial structure has improved to be closer to that of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE; BBB+/Stable). Core EBITDA of both companies is between 1.5x-2.0x. There is a modest different in financial policies, with <b>Dell</b> targeting to distribute 80%+ of FCF compared to 60% of FCF at HPE. This is partially explainable by HPE considering M&A to be a core component of its expected growth, compared to <b>Dell</b> who is targeting smaller more strategic value tuck in acquisitions. HPE's profitability benefits from higher EBITDA margin than <b>Dell</b> partially attributable to HPE's software exposure and nearly two-thirds mix <b>Dell</b>'s sales mix from relatively lower margin PC and peripherals sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared to HP Inc. (HP; BBB+/Stable) <b>Dell</b>'s industry profile rating sub-factor is one notch above HP, as <b>Dell</b> business profile relatively benefits from its exposure to the server and storage market. HP has a comparable PC business to <b>Dell</b> and faces secular challenges in its printing business. HP's financial profile is stronger than <b>Dell</b>'s, with higher FCF margins and a historically more conservative financial structure. HP Inc has the most aggressive shareholder return policy compared to HPE and <b>Dell</b>, with a plan to return approximately 100% of FCF to shareholders while under 2.0x gross leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--ISG and CSG revenues improve in fiscal 2H24 over fiscal 1H24 continuing on fiscal 2Q24 trend, but remain tempered by broad customer spending restraint;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fiscal 2025 revenues modestly up sequentially, directionally informed by "Global Economic Outlook - September 2023" and the expectation of some improvement in Enterprise demand. Revenues during latter half of forecast mid-single-digit growth in ISG and mid- to low-single-digit growth in CSG;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-18 October 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-3 (DEFT 2023-3). The transaction is a securitization of equipment receivables originated by <b>Dell</b> Financial Services L.L.C. (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A1 ; Short Term Rating; New Rating; F1+sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A2 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; BBBsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance ? Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2023-3 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is about 'A-'/'BBB+', stronger than the two recent transactions in 2023. Although the amount of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2023-3 is lower than in recent transactions, there remains a sizable portion, but these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk ? Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top-10 obligors and the top 20 obligors represent 4.69%, 28.69% and 39.93% of DEFT 2023-3, respectively. These levels are lower than DEFT 2023-2 and 2023-1 transactions. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, the top 10 obligors are mostly IG entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Base-Case Loss Proxy ? Strong but Normalizing Asset Performance: Loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in the late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations showed low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has shown a normalizing trend compared with the strength shown through the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The base case CNL proxy for DEFT 2023-3 is 1.20%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis ? Sufficient Credit Enhancement: All classes benefit from a cash reserve account and overcollateralization (OC). Total initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A, B, C and D notes is 12.00%, 9.50%, 7.25% and 5.25%, respectively. CE levels for classes A, B and C are lower than for DEFT 2023-2 but similar to levels seen in the three prior transactions. All classes benefit from 2.58% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk ? Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: <span class="companylink">DFS</span> has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. Additionally, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to nine from one. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared with the primary scenario and the ratings to the DEFT 2023-3 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative, as it does not take into consideration the build in enhancement as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial base case CNL and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2023-3 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CRITERIA VARIATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Model Implied Rating: The 2023-3 analysis incorporates criteria variations to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "U.S. Equipment Lease and Loan ABS Rating Criteria." Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, the committee's rating determination may deviate from the model-implied-rating (MIR) by up to one full rating category (three rating notches) due to qualitative considerations such as asset performance or the transaction's structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The variation relates to the 2023-3 class C notes having a MIR of 'AAAsf', which is two categories above the assigned rating of 'Asf'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that this criteria variation is warranted due to high obligor concentration risk, class C's significant reliance upon the excess spread and its sensitivity to the downgrade of top obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP</span>. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on the comparison and recomputation of certain information with respect to 175 contracts from the preliminary collateral pool of assets in connection with DEFT 2023-3. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis or conclusions.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-04 October 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> expects to assign ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-3 (DEFT 2023-3). The transaction is a securitization of equipment receivables originated by <b>Dell</b> Financial Services L.L.C. (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-3</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A1 ; Short Term Rating; Expected Rating; F1+(EXP)sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A2 ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; BBB(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance ? Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2023-3 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) obligors. The weighted-average (WA) rating of the top 10 rated obligors is about 'A-'/'BBB+', stronger than the two recent transactions in 2023. Although the amount of non-IG obligors in DEFT 2023-3 is lower than in recent transactions, there remains a sizable portion, but these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk ? Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top-10 obligors and the top 20 obligors represent 4.69%, 28.69% and 39.93% of DEFT 2023-3, respectively. These levels are lower than DEFT 2023-2 and 2023-1 transactions. While there is high concentration within the top 10 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, the top 10 obligors are mostly IG entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Base-Case Loss Proxy ? Strong but Normalizing Asset Performance: Loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in the late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations showed low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has shown a normalizing trend compared with the strength shown through the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The base case CNL proxy for DEFT 2023-3 is 1.20%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top 20 obligors and shorter contract terms than those of other equipment ABS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis ? Sufficient Credit Enhancement: All classes benefit from a cash reserve account and overcollateralization (OC). Total initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A, B, C and D notes is 12.00%, 9.50%, 7.25% and 5.25%, respectively. CE levels for classes A, B and C are lower than for DEFT 2023-2 but similar to levels seen in prior three transactions. All classes benefit from 2.18% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top 10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk ? Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: <span class="companylink">DFS</span> has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. Additionally, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to nine from one. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared with the primary scenario and the ratings to the DEFT 2023-3 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative, as it does not take into consideration the build in enhancement as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial base case CNL and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2023-3 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-22 June 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-2 (DEFT 2023-2). The transaction is a securitization of equipment receivables originated by <b>Dell</b> Financial Services L.L.C. (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; New Rating; F1+sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; AAAsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----C ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; Asf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; New Rating; BBBsf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance ? Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2023-2 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) obligors. The weighted average (WA) rating of the top-10 rated obligors is about 'BBB+'/'BBB', consistent with DEFT 2023-1 and other recent DEFT transactions. There is a large portion of non-IG obligors, but these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk ? Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top-10 obligors and the top-20 obligors represent 4.71%, 30.51% and 44.90% of DEFT 2023-2, respectively. These levels are in line with DEFT 2023-1 and prior 2021 and 2020 DEFT transactions. While there is high concentration within the top-15 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. The top-15 obligors are mostly IG entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Base-Case Loss Proxy ? Strong but Normalizing Asset Performance: Loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations exhibited low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has shown a normalizing trend compared with the strength exhibited through the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The base case CNL proxy for DEFT 2023-2 is 1.20%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top-20 obligors and shorter contract terms compared to those of other equipment ABS transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis ? Sufficient Credit Enhancement: All classes benefit from a cash reserve account and overcollateralization (OC). Total initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A, B, C and D notes is 13.65%, 12.60%, 10.35% and 6.90%, respectively. CE levels for classes A, B and C are higher than for DEFT 2023-1 and the 2022 transactions. All classes benefit from 2.69% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top-10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk ? Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: <span class="companylink">DFS</span> has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. Additionally, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to 13 from six. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared with the primary scenario and the ratings to the DEFT 2023-2 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative, as it does not take into consideration the build in enhancement as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial base case CNL and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2023-2 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Structured Finance transactions have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of seven notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of seven notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAAsf' to 'Dsf'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-07 June 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> expects to assign ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by <b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-2 (DEFT 2023-2). The transaction is a securitization of equipment receivables originated by <b>Dell</b> Financial Services L.L.C. (DFS) or its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> Equipment Finance Trust 2023-2</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-1 ; Short Term Rating; Expected Rating; F1+(EXP)sf</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-2 ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----A-3 ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AAA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----B ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; AA(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----D ; Long Term Rating; Expected Rating; BBB(EXP)sf; Rating Outlook Stable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral/Obligor Performance ? Strong Credit Quality: Consistent with prior DEFT transactions, DEFT 2023-2 has a high concentration of investment-grade (IG) obligors. The weighted average (WA) rating of the top-10 rated obligors is about 'BBB+'/'BBB', consistent with DEFT 2023-1 and other recent DEFT transactions. There is a large portion of non-IG obligors, but these obligors have historically demonstrated low default and loss experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concentration Risk ? Obligor Concentration: The largest obligor, the top-10 obligors and the top-20 obligors represent 4.71%, 30.51% and 44.90% of DEFT 2023-2, respectively. These levels are in line with DEFT 2023-1 and prior 2021 and 2020 DEFT transactions. While there is high concentration within the top-15 obligors, concentration declines significantly after that and is more consistent with traditional small-ticket equipment ABS transactions. Furthermore, the top-15 obligors are mostly IG entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the unique collateral characteristics of DEFT transactions, a modified obligor concentration approach is the primary rating driver as opposed to the stressed loss approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forward-Looking Approach to Derive Base-Case Loss Proxy ? Strong but Normalizing Asset Performance: Loss performance in the small and medium business (SMB) segment remains strong, at or below the portfolio's historical average, improving from the weakness in late 2020 and early 2021. The public and large institutions (PLI) segment has seen low default rates due to the sturdy credit profiles of these obligors. All DFS-sponsored securitizations exhibited low cumulative net losses (CNLs), but performance of recent DEFT transactions has shown a normalizing trend compared with the strength exhibited through the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The base case CNL proxy for DEFT 2023-2 is 1.20%, but the ratings are determined based on a modified obligor coverage approach given the transaction's high concentration of IG obligors among the top-20 obligors and shorter contract terms compared to those of other equipment ABS transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structural Analysis ? Sufficient Credit Enhancement: All classes benefit from a cash reserve account and overcollateralization (OC). Total initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A, B, C and D notes is 13.65%, 12.60%, 10.35% and 6.90%, respectively. CE levels for classes A, B and C are higher than for DEFT 2023-1 and the 2022 transactions. All classes benefit from 2.17% per annum of excess spread. The structure can support the default of the top-10, eight, six and four non-IG obligors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational and Servicing Risk ? Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: <span class="companylink">DFS</span> has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults could produce CNL levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining net loss coverage levels available to the notes. Additionally, unanticipated declines in recoveries could also result in a decline in net loss coverage. Decreased net loss coverage may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts a sensitivity of the obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been downgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB' would be downgraded to 'BB'. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. The results of this analysis showed that all of the classes would experience a multi-notch downgrade. The severity of these downgrades is driven by the 'BBB' range obligors being downgraded to non-IG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The top 20 obligors downgraded to non-IG increases to 13 from six. This results in higher loss hurdles when compared with the primary scenario and the ratings to the DEFT 2023-2 notes would be downgraded. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers this analysis conservative, as it does not take into consideration the build in enhancement as the transaction de-levers. In reality, downgrades of entities occur over a longer period, which would give the transaction time to de-lever as the collateral pool amortizes. Furthermore, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the likelihood of a simultaneous downgrade of these entities unlikely and, therefore, views this scenario as remote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducts sensitivity analyses by stressing both a transaction's initial base case CNL and recovery rate assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The CNL sensitivity stresses the CNL proxy to the level necessary to reduce each rating by one full category, to non-IG (BBsf) and to 'CCCsf' based on the break-even loss coverage provided by the CE structure. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies 1.5x and 2.0x increases to the CNL proxy, which represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also evaluates the impact of stressed recovery rates on an equipment ABS structure and rating impact with a 50% haircut. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating analysis for DEFT 2023-2 only assumes a 3.50% recovery credit. Given the low recovery assumption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> did not conduct a recovery rate sensitivity for this rating analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable to improved asset performance driven by stable delinquencies and defaults would lead to increasing CE levels and consideration for potential upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> conducted a sensitivity of the aforementioned obligor concentration coverage approach in which the ratings of the top 20 obligors were assumed to have been upgraded by a single rating category. For example, an obligor currently rated 'BBB-' was assumed to have been upgraded to 'A-' at close. No rating migration applies to unrated entities, as they were already categorized as non-IG in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary analysis. This results in lower loss hurdles when compared to the primary scenario and the commensurate ratings would remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Structured Finance transactions have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of seven notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of seven notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAAsf' to 'Dsf'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

The manner of Fitch?s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-10 January 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has rated co-issuers, <b>Dell</b> International LLC's and <span class="companylink">EMC Corp</span>.'s, senior notes 'BBB'. The senior notes will be pari passu with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s senior unsecured obligations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the transaction to be leverage neutral and the companies will use net proceeds to repay $1 billion of 5.45% senior notes due June 2023 and any remaining net proceeds for corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Financial Profile: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s strengthened financial profile with solid adjusted FCF and low core leverage (core debt/core EBITDA) provides flexibility as the company faces nearer-term headwinds from weakening PC shipments and enterprise infrastructure spending amidst concerns over recession. Over the longer term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects modest but consistent organic revenue growth and the company to sustain profit margins and cash flow metrics, which should enable the company to maintain target core credit metrics of 1.5x-2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PC Market Leader: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> to continue outperforming the PC market through share consolidation on top of stronger and more resilient than previously expected market growth. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s computing solutions group (<span class="companylink">CSG</span>) segment is poised for another year of double-digit growth from solid consumer PC demand and recovering commercial markets. Scale-driven market consolidation by the top three PC makers, including <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, should continue to fuel growth for this business, despite long-held risks of PC market maturation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Demand Environment: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects challenging infrastructure spending dynamics will constrain growth for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s infrastructure solutions group (<span class="companylink">ISG</span>) segment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts low-single-digit growth for <span class="companylink">ISG</span>, but demand for infrastructure spending will remain volatile and constrained by customer hybrid infrastructure-optimization trends. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects macroeconomic headwinds and digestion of robust demand for PCs during the COVID-19 pandemic will weigh on near-term revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Standalone Profitability Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s profit margins will moderate from peak levels in recent years over the near term, due to macroeconomic headwinds, including higher input prices. The resumption of <span class="companylink">ISG</span> and commercial PC growth should drive modest profit margin expansion over the longer term, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts core EBITDA margins will remain in the high-single digits, down from 10% in in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s credit profile is in-line with the 'BBB' rating, with the company's strong financial structure and flexibility, diversification and scale-based competitive advantages offsetting mature growth dynamics and comparatively low profitability. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s business profile is well-positioned compared with IT hardware provider peers, including <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (<span class="companylink">HPE</span>; BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">HP Inc</span>. (BBB+/Stable), given the scale and diversification of its installed base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial structure is in line with that of <span class="companylink">HPE</span>, with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s slightly stronger and more consistent cash flow profile offset by <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s higher profit margins due to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s nearly two-thirds mix of PC and peripherals sales. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s operating profile is equally positioned to that of <span class="companylink">HP</span>, which has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business. However, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile is stronger, with higher FCF margins and a more conservative financial structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s 'BBB' Long-Term IDR maps to either 'F2' or 'F3' short-term ratings under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Corporate Rating Criteria and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial flexibility factor is in-line with the minimum 'bbb+' that is required for the higher of the two short-term ratings. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria emphasizes the liquidity sub-factor, which has strengthened considerably now that core debt maturities should be easily manageable with core FCF through the forecast period. The 'F2' short-term rating also reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> comfortably meeting the criteria's requirement of at least a 'bbb-' financial structure and 'a-' operating environment factor score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revenue declines by low- to mid-single digits in fiscal 2023 and 2024, reflecting weaker demand, particularly in PCs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue grows by low single digits through the remainder of the forecast period from ongoing market-share gains;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profitability moderates in fiscal 2023 and remains challenged in fiscal 2024 before expanding with a sales mix shift to <span class="companylink">ISG</span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> uses cash flow for a combination of shareholder returns and debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage at or below 2.0x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from profitable market-share gains in <span class="companylink">CSG</span> and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage sustained above 2.5x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 20%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market-share losses in <span class="companylink">CSG</span> and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity should remain adequate and, as of Oct. 28, 2022, was supported by $4.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $6 billion revolving credit facility expiring in 2027, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects will back-stop <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of annual adjusted FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider, with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning both traditional and emerging, multi-cloud technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> calculates core metrics for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, which exclude the impact of the capital financing business, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services</span> (DFS). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies a maximum allowable leverage ratio for DFS of 4:1 to financing receivables as part of its core debt estimation. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also excludes changes in DFS financing receivables to arrive at adjust cash flow metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-18 July 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BBB' long-term ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>. (Parent) and its subsidiaries, <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corp</span>. (Co-borrowers), as well as the 'BBB' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'BBB-' senior unsecured ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b>, Inc</span>. (Legacy notes). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also assigned a 'F2' Short-Term IDR to the parent and the co-borrowers and 'F2' rating to the co-borrowers' CP program. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The CP program authorizes up to $5 billion of borrowings by the co-borrowers and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company's $5 billion revolving credit facility due Nov. 1, 2026 will back-stop the program. The CP program is guaranteed by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>., Denali Intermediate, Inc. and <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b>, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Financial Profile: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s strengthened financial profile with solid adjusted FCF and low core leverage (core debt/core EBITDA), provides flexibility as the company faces nearer-term headwinds from weakening PC shipments and enterprise infrastructure spending amidst concerns over recession. Over the longer term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects modest but consistent organic revenue growth and the company to sustain profit margins and cash flow metrics, which should enable the company to maintain target core credit metrics of 1.5x-2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PC Market Leader: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> to continue outperforming the PC market through share consolidation on top of stronger and more resilient than previously expected market growth. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s computing solutions group (CSG) segment is poised for another year of double-digit growth from solid consumer PC demand and recovering commercial markets. Scale-driven market consolidation by the top three PC makers, including <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, should continue to fuel growth for this business, despite long-held risks of PC market maturation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Infrastructure Spending Dynamics: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects challenging infrastructure spending dynamics will constrain growth for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s infrastructure solutions group (<span class="companylink">ISG</span>) segment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts low-single-digit growth for <span class="companylink">ISG</span> but demand for infrastructure spending will remain volatile and constrained by customer hybrid infrastructure-optimization trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Standalone Profitability Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s profit margins will moderate from peak levels in recent years over the near term, due to macroeconomic headwinds and normalization of operating expenses from actions taken during the pandemic. The resumption of <span class="companylink">ISG</span> and commercial PC growth should drive modest profit margin expansion over the longer term, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts core EBITDA margins will remain near 9%, down from 10% in in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s credit profile is in-line with the 'BBB' rating, with the company's strong financial structure and flexibility, diversification and scale-based competitive advantages offsetting mature growth dynamics and comparatively low profitability. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s business profile is well-positioned compared with IT hardware provider peers, including <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (<span class="companylink">HPE</span>; BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">HP Inc</span>. (BBB+/Stable), given the scale and diversification of its installed base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial structure is in line with that of <span class="companylink">HPE</span>, with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s slightly stronger and more consistent cash flow profile offset by <span class="companylink">HPE</span>'s higher profit margins due to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s nearly two-thirds mix of PC and peripherals sales. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s operating profile is equally positioned to that of <span class="companylink">HP</span>, which has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business. However, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile is stronger, with higher FCF margins and a more conservative financial structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s 'BBB' Long-Term IDR maps to either 'F2' or 'F3' short-term ratings under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Corporate Rating Criteria and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial flexibility factor is in-line with the minimum 'bbb+' that is required for the higher of the two short-term ratings. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria emphasizes the liquidity sub-factor, which has strengthened considerably now that core debt maturities should be easily manageable with core FCF through the forecast period. The 'F2' short-term also reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> comfortably meeting the criteria's requirement of at least a 'bbb-' financial structure and 'a-' operating environment factor score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revenue declines by low-single-digit decline in fiscal 2023, reflecting a weakening PC market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue grows by low single digits through the remainder of the forecast period from ongoing market-share gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profitability moderates in fiscal 2023 and gradually expands with a shift in ISG mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> cash flow for a combination of shareholder returns, including a potential and debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage at or below 2.0x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from profitable market-share gains in CSG and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage sustained above 2.5x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market-share losses in CSG and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity should remain adequate and, as of April 29, 2022, was supported by $6.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $5 billion revolving credit facility expiring on Nov. 1, 2026, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects will back-stop <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s CP program. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of adjusted FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider, with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning both traditional and emerging, multi-cloud technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aside from standard financial statement adjustments, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> calculates core metrics for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, which exclude the impact of the capital financing business, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Financial Services</span> (DFS). Upon <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s upgrade of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> to 'BBB' in connection with the company's separation from <span class="companylink">VMware</span> and subsequent deleveraging, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> increased the maximum allowable leverage for DFS to 4:1 from 3:1. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> applies this multiple to financing receivables as part of its core debt estimation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-06 December 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB' ratings to the senior unsecured notes offering of co-issuers, <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corp</span>. The notes will be pari passu with the co-issuers' existing senior unsecured debt, other than <span class="companylink">EMC</span>'s legacy senior notes. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> will use net proceeds to fund the tender, including premiums, primarily for senior notes due 2036 and 2046, a transaction announced in conjunction with the new senior notes offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s strengthened financial structure and flexibility from the company's use of cash flow and net proceeds from the tax-free spin-off of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>. for debt reduction. This, in conjunction with a solid demand environment, results in Fitch-estimates core debt to core EBITDA (core leverage), which exclude the impact of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s captive financing unit, approaching 2.0x in the near term. In addition, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s FCF will be available for a mix of investments in growth and capital returns, even as it continues reducing debt to achieve its long-term core leverage target of 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Balance Sheet: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> used its $9.3 billion-$9.7 billion pro rata share of VMware's $11.5 billion dividend paid in connection with the spin-off for debt reduction. As a result, pro forma credit metrics in-line with a strong 'BBB' rating with core debt to operating EBITDA below 2.5x and approaching 2.0x in fiscal 2023 and heading toward <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s longer-term 1.5x core leverage target. With profitability more in-line with a strong 'BB' rating balanced against a financial profile more in-line with a weak 'A' rating, Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s overall credit profile is consistent with a 'BBB' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid PC Business Momentum: Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> to continue outperforming the PC market through share consolidation on top of stronger and more resilient than previously expected market growth. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s computing solutions group (CSG) segment is poised for another year of double-digit growth from solid consumer PC demand and recovering commercial markets. Scale-driven market consolidation by the top three PC makers, including <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, should continue to fuel growth for this business, despite long-held risks of PC market maturation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Infrastructure Spending Dynamics: Fitch expects challenging infrastructure spending dynamics will constrain growth for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s infrastructure solutions group (<span class="companylink">ISG</span>) segment, although Fitch forecasts spending will recover in fiscal 2H22 after significant demand constraints in fiscal 2021 due to pandemic-driven lockdowns. While Fitch forecasts low-single-digit growth for <span class="companylink">ISG</span> in fiscal 2022, demand for infrastructure spending will remain volatile and constrained to low-single-digit average growth by customer hybrid infrastructure-optimization trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Standalone Profitability Profile: Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s post-spin-off profit margins will moderate in fiscal 2022 from peak levels in recent years, due in large part to normalization of cost actions during the pandemic and continued momentum in lower-margin consumer PCs. The resumption of <span class="companylink">ISG</span> and commercial PC growth should drive modest profit margin expansion beginning in fiscal 2023, although Fitch forecasts core EBITDA margins will remain near 9%, versus nearly 10% in fiscal 2020-2021 and FCF margins adjusted for <b>Dell</b> Financial Services LLC receivables change in the low- to mid-single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s credit profile is in-line with the 'BBB' rating, with the company's strong financial structure and flexibility, diversification and scale-based competitive advantages offsetting mature growth dynamics and comparatively low profitability. Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s business profile is well-positioned compared with IT hardware provider peers, including <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (HPE; BBB+/Negative) and <span class="companylink">HP Inc</span>. (BBB+/Stable), given the scale and diversification of its installed base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Following the spin-off, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial structure is in line with that of HPE, with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s slightly stronger and more consistent cash flow profile offset by HPE's higher profit margins due to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s nearly two-thirds mix of PC and peripherals sales. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s operating profile is equally positioned to that of <span class="companylink">HP</span>, which has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business. However, <span class="companylink">HP</span>'s financial profile is stronger, with higher FCF margins and a more conservative financial structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revenue grows by nearly 10% in fiscal 2022, followed by a mid-single-digit decline in fiscal 2023, reflecting VMware's full-year separation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a standalone basis, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revenue grows by low single digits in fiscal 2021-2025, from ongoing market share gains in CSG and a gradually improving infrastructure-spending environment as PC demand moderates;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profitability moderates in fiscal 2022 and gradually expands with a shift in ISG mix and normalizing input costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> uses 40%-60% of adjusted pre-dividend FCF for capital returns balanced against ongoing debt reduction to achieve target core leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage at or below 2.0x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from profitable market-share gains in CSG and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage sustained above 2.5x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market-share losses in CSG and <span class="companylink">ISG</span> segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity should remain adequate. It was supported by $11.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of Oct. 29, 2021, along with an undrawn $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in 2026. Fitch's forecast of $3.5 billion-$4.5 billion of adjusted FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. For more information on Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores, visit www.fitchratings.com/esg[http://www.fitchratings.com/esg].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider, with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning both traditional and emerging, multi-cloud technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch applies a maximum allowable debt-to-equity ratio of 4:1 to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financing receivables to allocate a portion of total debt to DFS, which Fitch excludes from measuring core debt. Fitch similarly excludes DFS profitability from total EBITDA to calculate core EBITDA, as well as the change in financing receivables from FFO in calculating adjusted FCF.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-01 November 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has resolved the Rating Watch Positive on the ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>. and its subsidiaries in connection with the company's completion of the <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>. spin-off and upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has affirmed the first-lien secured ratings at 'BBB' in anticipation of the collateral supporting the first-lien debt falling away and leaving it pari passu with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s non-legacy senior unsecured obligations, including <b>Dell</b> International LLC's senior unsecured notes, which Fitch has upgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. Finally, Fitch has upgraded the structurally subordinated legacy senior notes of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Inc</span>. to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. A Stable Rating Outlook has been assigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings reflect <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s meaningfully strengthened credit profile following the company's ongoing use of cash flow and net proceeds from the tax-free spin-off of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>. for debt reduction. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> has reduced debt by $6.5 billion fiscal year-to-date and, in conjunction with stronger than expected operating results, Fitch-estimates core debt to core EBITDA, which exclude the impact of <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s captive financing unit, are below 2.5x following the spin-off and will approach 2.0x in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Significant Debt Reduction: <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> will use its approximately $9.3 billion-$9.7 billion pro rata share of VMware's $11.5 billion dividend paid in connection with the spin-off for debt reduction. As a result, pro forma credit metrics will be in-line with a strong 'BBB' rating with core debt to operating EBITDA below 2.5x and approaching 2.0x in fiscal 2023 and heading toward <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s longer-term 1.5x core leverage target. With profitability more in-line with a strong 'BB' rating balanced against a financial profile more in-line with a weak 'A' rating, Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s overall credit profile is consistent with a 'BBB' LT IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The spin-off simplifies VMware's ownership structure and results in <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> shareholders' proforma ownership interest in VMware just under 30% and Michael <b>Dell</b> and Silver Lake Partners (SLP) just over 40% and 10%, respectively. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> also announced that it has entered into a partnership with VMware aimed at joint collaboration and product development, leveraging <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s go-to-market (GTM) scale, other cross-selling opportunities and <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s captive financing business (DFS). The partnership is set to last five years from close with automatic one-year renewals thereafter and should remain additive to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s top line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid PC Business Momentum: Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> to continue outperforming the PC market through share consolidation on top of stronger and more resilient than previously expected market growth. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s computing solutions group (CSG) segment is poised for another year of double-digit growth from solid consumer PC demand and recovering commercial markets. Scale-driven market consolidation by the top three PC makers, including <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>, should continue to fuel growth for this business, despite long-held risks of PC market maturation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Infrastructure Spending Dynamics: Fitch expects challenging infrastructure spending dynamics will constrain growth for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s infrastructure solutions group (ISG) segment, although Fitch forecasts spending will recover in fiscal 2H22 after significant demand constraints in fiscal 2021 due to pandemic-driven lockdowns. While Fitch forecasts low-single-digit growth for ISG in fiscal 2022, demand for infrastructure spending will remain volatile and constrained to low-single-digit average growth by customer hybrid infrastructure-optimization trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Standalone Profitability Profile: Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s post-spin-off profit margins will moderate in fiscal 2022 from peak levels in recent years, due in large part to normalization of cost actions during the pandemic and continued momentum in lower-margin consumer PCs. The resumption of ISG and commercial PC growth should drive modest profit margin expansion beginning in fiscal 2023, although Fitch forecasts core EBITDA margins will remain near 9%, versus nearly 10% in fiscal 2020-2021 and FCF margins adjusted for <b>Dell</b> Financial Services LLC receivables change in the low- to mid-single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s credit profile is in-line with the 'BBB' rating, with the company's strong financial structure and flexibility, diversification and scale-based competitive advantages offsetting mature growth dynamics and comparatively low profitability. Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s business profile is well-positioned compared with IT hardware provider peers, including <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (HPE; BBB+/Negative) and <span class="companylink">HP Inc</span>. (BBB+/Stable), given the scale and diversification of its installed base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Following the spin-off, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s financial structure is in line with that of HPE, with <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s slightly stronger and more consistent cash flow profile offset by HPE's higher profit margins due to <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s nearly two-thirds mix of PC and peripherals sales. <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s operating profile is equally positioned to that of HP, which has a comparable PC business and faces secular challenges in its printing business. However, HP's financial profile is stronger, with higher FCF margins and a more conservative financial structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revenue grows by nearly 10% in fiscal 2022, followed by a mid-single-digit decline in fiscal 2023, reflecting VMware's full-year separation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a standalone basis, <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s revenue grows by low single digits in fiscal 2021-2025, from ongoing market share gains in CSG and a gradually improving infrastructure-spending environment as PC demand moderates;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profitability moderates in fiscal 2022 and gradually expands with a shift in ISG mix and normalizing input costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> uses cash flow for debt reduction to achieve target core leverage, with excess cash flow for stock buybacks and dividends rather than large-scale acquisitions thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage at or below 2.0x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from profitable market-share gains in CSG and ISG segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage sustained above 2.5x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market-share losses in CSG and ISG segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span>'s liquidity should remain adequate. It was supported by $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of July 30, 2021, along with an undrawn $4.5 billion of first lien senior secured revolving credit facility (RCF) expiring in September 2023. Fitch's forecast of $3.5 billion-$4.5 billion of adjusted FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b></span> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider, with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning both traditional and emerging, multi-cloud technologies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-17 September 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>. (<b>Dell</b>) and its subsidiaries, including their Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BB+', on <b>Dell</b>'s strengthened credit profile from ongoing debt reduction and solid operating momentum. Fitch has also upgraded <b>Dell</b> subsidiaries' debt ratings by one notch, including the senior secured to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'/'RR1', senior unsecured to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'/ 'RR4' and legacy notes to 'BB+' from 'BB/'RR5'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch is maintaining the Rating Watch Positive (RWP) on the Long-Term IDRs and issue ratings and expects to upgrade the IDRs and senior unsecured debt upon <b>Dell</b>'s spin-off of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>. Fitch expects to affirm the senior secured debt at 'BBB' upon the spin-off, given our anticipation that <b>Dell</b> will achieve investment-grade ratings by at least two of the three credit rating agencies noted in its senior secured credit agreement, releasing the collateral supporting the secured debt. The legacy notes will remain structurally subordinated to the rest of the unsecured capital structure and be upgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The current ratings are consistent with Fitch's revised "Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria," dated 9 April 2021, and, therefore, Fitch has removed <b>Dell</b> from Under Criteria Observation (UCO).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthened Credit Profile: <b>Dell</b>'s credit profile has strengthened from the ongoing use of free cash flow (FCF) for debt reduction, enabled by solid operating performance. The company has reduced core debt by $5.5 billion so far in the current fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2022, following at least $5 billion in each of the last two fiscal years, resulting in Fitch-estimated core leverage below our 3.0x positive rating sensitivity. Together with operating momentum, supported by solid demand for personal computers (PC), peripherals and servers, core leverage should decrease to 2.5x at FYE22, even were the spin-off not to occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Reduction Irrespective of Spin-off: Assuming the spin-off is consummated, Fitch expects <b>Dell</b> to continue using FCF, on top of $9.3 billion-$9.7 billion of net proceeds from the VMware dividend, for debt reduction until it achieves its 1.5x-2.0x long-term core leverage target. This equates to a slightly higher target range at Fitch, given our lower debt-to-equity ratio assumption for the captive-financing business. Upon achieving its target, Fitch expects <b>Dell</b> will maintain solid liquidity and use FCF for bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid PC Business Momentum: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b> to continue outperforming the personal computer (PC) market through share consolidation on top of stronger and more resilient-than-previously expected market growth. <b>Dell</b>'s computing solutions group (CSG) segment is poised for another year of double-digit growth from still solid consumer PC demand and recovering commercial markets. Scale-driven market consolidation by the top three PC makers, <b>Dell</b> among them, should continue fueling growth for this business, despite long-held risks of PC market maturation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Infrastructure Spending Dynamics: Fitch expects challenging infrastructure spending dynamics will constrain growth for <b>Dell</b>'s infrastructure solutions group (ISG) segment, although Fitch forecasts spending will recover in 2HFY22, after significant demand constraints in FY21 due to pandemic-driven lockdowns. While Fitch is forecasting low single-digit growth for ISG in FY22, demand for infrastructure spending will remain volatile and constrained to low single-digit average growth by customer hybrid infrastructure-optimization trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Standalone Profitability Profile: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b>'s post-spin-off profit margins will moderate in FY22 from peak levels achieved in recent years, due in large part to normalization of cost actions taken during the pandemic and continued momentum in lower-margin consumer PCs. The resumption of ISG and commercial PC growth should drive modest profit-margin expansion beginning in FY23, although Fitch forecasts core EBITDA margins will remain near 9% versus nearly 10% in FY20-FY21 and FCF margins adjusted for DFS receivables change in the low- to mid-single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pro-forma for the spin-off, <b>Dell</b>'s credit profile will be in line with the anticipated 'BBB' rating with the company's strong financial structure and flexibility, diversification and scale-based competitive advantage offsetting mature growth dynamics and comparatively low profitability. Fitch believes <b>Dell</b>'s business profile is well positioned versus that of IT hardware provider peers, including <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (HPE, BBB+/Negative) and <span class="companylink">HP, Inc</span>. (BBB+/Stable), given the scale and diversification of its installed base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b>'s pro-forma financial structure will be in line with that of HPE, with <b>Dell</b>'s slightly stronger and more consistent cash flow profile offset by HPE's higher profit margins, due to <b>Dell</b>'s nearly two-thirds mix of PC and peripherals sales. <b>Dell</b>'s operating profile is as firmly positioned as <span class="companylink">HP, Inc</span>.'s, which has a comparable PC business even as it faces secular challenges in its printing business. However, <span class="companylink">HP, Inc</span>.'s financial profile is stronger with stronger FCF margins and a more conservative financial structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The spin-off will eliminate the rating linkage between VMware and <b>Dell</b>. Until the transaction closes, the current ratings reflect Fitch's belief that <b>Dell</b>'s linkage with 80.6%-owned VMware is moderate under Fitch's Parent-Subsidiary Linkage (PSL) Criteria and, therefore, equalizes the companies' Long-Term IDRs. VMware is an unrestricted subsidiary in <b>Dell</b>'s credit agreements and indentures and provide for no upstream guarantees, cross-default provisions or management or treasury-team overlap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Dell</b>'s revenue grows by nearly 10% in FY22, followed by a mid-single-digit decline in FY23, reflecting VMware's full-year separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a standalone basis, <b>Dell</b>'s revenue grows by low single digits through FY21-FY25, from ongoing market-share gains in CSG and a gradually improving infrastructure-spending environment as PC demand moderates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profitability moderates in FY22 and gradually expands with a shift in ISG mix and normalizing input costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Dell</b> uses the majority of cash flow for debt reduction until it achieves target core leverage, and mainly for stock buybacks and, potentially, a dividend thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a consolidated basis (no spin-off), expectations for core leverage sustained at or below 2.5x and, on a post-spin-off standalone basis, expectations for core leverage at or below 2.0x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent organic revenue growth from profitable market-share gains in CSG and ISG segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--On a consolidated basis (no spin-off), expectations for core leverage sustained above 3.0x and, on a post-spin-off standalone basis, expectations for core leverage sustained above 2.5x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in organic revenue from sustained market-share losses in CSG and ISG segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch believes <b>Dell</b>'s liquidity should remain adequate and, as of July 30, 2021, was supported by $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents ($11.7 billion including VMware) and an undrawn $4.5 billion of 1st-lien senior secured revolving credit facility (RCF) expiring on September 2023 ($5.5 billion including VMware's undrawn $1 billion senior unsecured RCF due September 2022). Fitch's forecast of $3.5 billion-$4.5 billion of adjusted FCF also supports liquidity, excluding VMware's FCF at spin-off close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> is a leading global diversified technology infrastructure provider, with a comprehensive portfolio of IT hardware, software and service solutions spanning both traditional and emerging, multi-cloud technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch applies a maximum allowable debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 to <b>Dell</b>'s financing receivables to allocate a portion of total debt to DFS, which Fitch excludes from measuring core debt. Fitch similarly excludes DFS profitability from total EBITDA to calculate core EBITDA, as well as the change in financing receivables from FFO in calculating adjusted FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sources of Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Moderate PSL: We believe the PSL between <b>Dell</b> and its 80.6% owned subsidiary, VMware, is moderate. In Fitch's opinion, VMware's indentures or independent-related party committee do not constrain <b>Dell</b>'s ability to access VMware's cash. As a result, Fitch equalizes <b>Dell</b>'s and VMware's ratings. Fitch's PSL Criteria govern the derivation of VMware's ratings, given <b>Dell</b>'s 80.6% economic and 97% voting interests in VMware and consolidation of VMware's financial statements. Post-spin-off, the PSL will no longer apply to <b>Dell</b> and VMware.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-14 April 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has placed the ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>. (<b>Dell</b>) and its subsidiaries, including its 'BB+' Long-Term (LT) Issuer Default Rating (IDR), on Watch Positive following <b>Dell</b>'s announcement that it will spin-off its 81%-ownership stake in <span class="companylink">VMware Inc</span>. The transaction will take the form of a tax-free spin-off and is targeted to close in the fourth fiscal quarter of f2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At or near the transaction close, Fitch anticipates upgrading <b>Dell</b>'s ratings to 'BBB', absent the company falling meaningfully short of its organic debt reduction targets through the first three quarters of fiscal 2022. Fitch believes <b>Dell</b>'s operating profile supports a low- to mid-'BBB' rating with scale-based competitive advantages expected to drive continued share gains and its large diversified installed base moderating customer infrastructure spending volatility. Mature industry growth dynamics, particularly in its infrastructure solutions group (ISG), and limited pricing power weigh on <b>Dell</b>'s operating profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In connection with the transaction, VMware will pay an $11.5 billion-$12.0 billion cash dividend to shareholders and <b>Dell</b> will use its approximately $9.3 billion-$9.7 billion pro rata share and cash flow to close, for debt reduction. As a result, Fitch forecasts pro forma credit metrics in-line with a strong 'BBB' rating with core debt to operating EBITDA below 2.5x and approaching 2.0x exiting fiscal 2023, in-line with <b>Dell</b>'s longer-term core leverage target. With post-spin profitability more in-line with a strong 'BB' rating weighing on its financial profile, Fitch believes <b>Dell</b>'s overall credit profile is consistent with a 'BBB' LT IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The spin simplifies VMware's ownership structure and results in <b>Dell</b> shareholders' pro forma ownership interest in VMware just under 30% and Michael <b>Dell</b> and Silver Lake Partners (SLP) just over 40% and 10%, respectively. <b>Dell</b> also announced that it will enter into a partnership with VMware aimed at joint collaboration and product development, leveraging <b>Dell</b>'s go-to-market (GTM) scale, other cross-selling opportunities and <b>Dell</b>'s captive financing business (DFS). The partnership is set to last five years from close with automatic one-year renewals thereafter and should remain additive to <b>Dell</b>'s top line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Significant Debt Reduction: Aside from use of <b>Dell</b>'s $9.3 billion-$9.7 billion pro rata share of VMware's cash dividend in connection with the spin for debt reduction, Fitch believes operating momentum poises <b>Dell</b> to achieve its at least $5 billion organic debt reduction target for fiscal 2022. This follows $5.5 billion of gross debt reduction in fiscal 2021, aided by the use of net proceeds from closing the RSA sale, and use of virtually all cash flow for debt reduction (just over $8 billion of Fitch calculated net debt) over the little more than two years since <b>Dell</b>'s debt-funded VMware tracking stock consolidation sweetener.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Conservative Financial Policies: Fitch believes <b>Dell</b>'s post-spin financial policies will be conservative, spurred by the company's achieving and maintaining solid investment grade ratings. Fitch estimates core leverage (core debt to core EBITDA, which exclude the impact of DFS) will be near 2.5x at spin. <b>Dell</b>'s core leverage target (which will better but not entirely match Fitch's calculation post-spin) of 2.0x and anticipated liquidity are strong for Fitch's anticipated actions. Upon achieving its target, Fitch forecasts <b>Dell</b> will intensify the use of FCF for stock buybacks,.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid PC Business Momentum: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b> to continue outperforming the personal computer (PC) market through share consolidation on top of stronger and more resilient than previously expected market growth. <b>Dell</b>'s computing solutions group (CSG) segment is poised for another year of mid-single digit growth from consumer moderating from double digit growth in fiscal 2021 and recovering commercial markets. Scale driven market consolidation by the top three PC makers, <b>Dell</b> among them, should continue fueling growth for this business, despite long-held concern over PC market maturation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Infrastructure Spending Dynamics: Fitch expects challenging infrastructure spending dynamics will constrain growth for <b>Dell</b>'s infrastructure solutions group (ISG) segment, although Fitch forecasts spending will recover in the back half of fiscal 2022 after significant demand constraints in fiscal through last year's coronavirus pandemic-driven lockdowns. While Fitch is forecasting low single digit growth for ISG in fiscal 2022, demand for infrastructure spending will remain volatile and constrained to low single digit average growth by customer hybrid infrastructure optimization trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Standalone Profitability Profile: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b>'s post-spin profit margins will moderate in fiscal 2022 from peak levels achieved in recent years due in large part to normalization of cost actions taken during the coronavirus pandemic and continued momentum in lower margin consumer PCs. The resumption of ISG and commercial PC growth should drive modest profit margin expansion beginning in fiscal 2023, although Fitch forecasts core EBITDA margins will remain near 9% versus nearly 10% in fiscal 2020-2021 and FCF margins adjusted for the change in DFS receivables in the mid-single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Rationale: We notch up <b>Dell</b>'s secured debt by one notch to 'BBB-'/'RR2'due to our expectation for superior recoveries for first-lien debt, as the company's senior secured revolving credit facility, term loan and bonds are secured by substantially all assets of <b>Dell</b> and its subsidiaries, excluding VMware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pro forma for the spin, <b>Dell</b>'s credit profile will be in-line with the anticipated 'BBB' rating with the company's strong financial structure and flexibility, diversification and scale-based competitive advantage offsetting mature growth dynamics and comparatively low profitability. As a result, <b>Dell</b>'s business profile is favorably positioned versus IT hardware provider peers such as <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (rated 'BBB+' with a Negative Rating Outlook by Fitch) and <span class="companylink">HP, Inc</span>. (rated 'BBB+' with a Negative Rating Outlook by Fitch). <b>Dell</b>'s pro forma financial structure will be in-line with that of <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</span> but weaker than that of <span class="companylink">HP, Inc</span>. At the same time, <b>Dell</b> is similarly positioned to <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</span> from an operating profile perspective but at least as well positioned as HP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The spin-off will eliminate the rating linkage between VMware and <b>Dell</b>. Until the transaction closes, the current 'BB+' rating reflects Fitch's belief that <b>Dell</b>'s linkage with 81% owned VMware is moderate under Fitch's parent-subsidiary linkage criteria and, therefore, equalizes the companies' LT IDRs. <span class="companylink">VMware</span> is an unrestricted subsidiary in <b>Dell</b>'s credit agreements and indentures and provide for no upstream guarantees, cross-default provisions or management or treasury team overlap.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The tax-free spin-off closes as currently contemplated in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021 with <b>Dell</b> using a $9.3-$9.7 billion cash dividend from VMware for debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Standalone revenue for <b>Dell</b> grows by low- to mid-single digits driven by share gains through forecast period within the context of solid market growth through fiscal 2023 and moderating thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profitability moderates in fiscal 2022 but an increasing mix of ISG sales gradually drive profit margin expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Dell</b> uses the majority of cash flow for debt reduction until it achieves target core leverage and mainly for stock buybacks thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core debt to core EBITDA sustained below 2x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive organic revenue growth from profitable market share gains in CSG and ISG segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core debt to core EBITDA sustained near 3x and adjusted pre-dividend FCF to core debt sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative organic revenue growth from sustained market share losses in CSG and ISG segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch believes <b>Dell</b>'s liquidity should remain adequate and, as of Jan. 29, 2021, was supported by $14.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $9.5 billion excluding VMware, and nearly full availability of <b>Dell</b>'s $4.5 billion of 1st-lien senior secured revolving credit facility expiring on September 2023 and VMware's undrawn $1 billion senior unsecured RCF due September 2022. Fitch's forecast for $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of adjusted FCF also supports liquidity and excludes VMware's more than $3 billion of FCF to spin-close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch applies a maximum allowable debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 to <b>Dell</b>'s financing receivables to allocate a portion of total debt to DFS, which Fitch excludes from measuring core debt. Fitch similarly excludes DFS profitability from total EBITDA to calculate core EBITDA, as well as the change in financing receivables from FFO in calculating adjusted FCF.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-16 February 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'BB+'. Fitch has also revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. Fitch's actions affect $54.9 billion of total debt, including the undrawn $4.5 billion first-lien senior secured revolving credit facility (RCF).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <b>Dell</b>'s strengthened credit profile, driven by better than expected operating performance enabling achievement of its debt-reduction targets in each of the past two fiscal years. Fitch believes <b>Dell</b> ended the fiscal year with core leverage (core debt to core EBITDA) below 3.5x and is positioned to trigger Fitch's positive 3.0x core leverage rating sensitivity in the near term if <b>Dell</b> remains focused on using substantially all cash flow for permanent debt reduction. This view excludes likely significant debt reduction in connection with a potential spinoff of <span class="companylink">VMware, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects modest positive revenue growth on average and over the long term for <b>Dell</b>, excluding VMware. Share consolidation and peripherals penetration will drive personal computer (PC) growth, while <b>Dell</b>'s large and diversified installed base will moderate cyclical on-premise infrastructure spending growth. Fitch expects stronger than previously forecasted operating performance over the near term, driven by a continuation of coronavirus-driven momentum in PCs through 1H22 and recovering infrastructure spending beginning in 2H22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects <b>Dell</b>'s profitability and cash flow will moderate from record fiscal 2Q21 and 3Q21 levels, with lower operating expenses and savings initiatives related to the coronavirus normalizing and offsetting the resumption of growth in <b>Dell</b>'s higher margin infrastructure businesses. Fitch forecasts <b>Dell</b>'s FCF adjusted for the change in finance receivables (excluding VMware) for fiscal 2021 was roughly flat from fiscal 2020 at $4.5 billion. This should also moderate to the $3 billion-$4 billion range through the forecast period, but should provide ample capacity for substantial incremental debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deleveraging Remains Focus: Following two consecutive years of more than $5 billion of targeted debt reduction, <b>Dell</b>'s previously articulated goal of achieving investment grade (IG) ratings implies further deleveraging through at least some debt reduction. Fitch forecasts $3 billion-$4 billion of <b>Dell</b> adjusted FCF (excluding VMware), providing capacity to meet a portion of the company's roughly $1.5 billion of debt maturities in fiscal 2022. Fitch also anticipates any contemplated spinoff transaction would be accompanied by a dividend sufficient to ensure IG capital structures for both <b>Dell</b> and VMware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PC Outperformance: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b>, along with other top-three PC makers, continuing to take market share from increasingly subscale players as core to <b>Dell</b>'s intermediate- to long-term PC growth opportunity. Strengthening sales mix and increasing penetration of peripherals should also enable <b>Dell</b> to outgrow the broader market, despite reaching the end of the Win10 PC refresh cycle. Fitch nonetheless forecasts moderating revenue growth in <b>Dell</b>'s PC business following significant outperformance in fiscal 2021, driven by work-from-home dynamics related to the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Secular ISG Headwinds: Fitch expects the ongoing consolidation of hardware spending by service providers should result in mature and cyclical growth rates for small- to medium-size business (SMB) and enterprise spending, and thus for <b>Dell</b>'s infrastructure solutions group (ISG). <b>Dell</b>'s large and diversified installed base should enable modest revenue growth on average, assuming execution on product roadmaps and go-to-market strategies. ISG should begin recovering in fiscal 2022 following two consecutive years of midsingle-digit negative revenue growth as customers digested robust U.S. tax reform-fueled spending during fiscal 2020 and were constrained by the coronavirus in fiscal 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Moderating Profitability: Fitch forecasts moderating profitability for standalone <b>Dell</b> due to the normalization of operating expenses following lower variable costs and expense-reduction steps taken at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Fitch expects core EBITDA margins for standalone <b>Dell</b> to decline from a Fitch-estimated 9.4% in fiscal 2021, but to remain in the high single digits with the alleviation of supply constraints and recovering infrastructure sales, which carry higher operating income margins than PCs, in the second half of fiscal 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Continued VMware Strength: Fitch expects a continuation of strong operating performance from VMware, driven by robust adoption of the company's full infrastructure stack solutions and growing mix of recurring revenue and cash flow. Software-as-a-service and support revenue increased to three-quarters of the total in fiscal 2021, up from just half roughly a year ago. After stronger than expected coronavirus-driven organic revenue growth in fiscal 2021, VMware should grow by mid to high single digits overall and generate nearly $3 billion of annual FCF by leveraging the company's large and diversified installed base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b>'s 'BB+' rating reflects the company's flexibility to meet aggressive debt-reduction targets on its deleveraging path, with more than $4 billion of adjusted FCF forecast for fiscal 2021. The rating also reflects the company's leadership positions in PCs, which should enable the company and its market-leading peers to grow via share gains from increasingly subscale competitors. Finally, the rating also considers <b>Dell</b>'s significant installed base in SMBs through legacy <b>Dell</b> and large enterprises via its acquisition of <span class="companylink">EMC Corp</span>., which enabled, among other things, strong cross-selling execution across <b>Dell</b>, VMware and <b>Dell</b>'s captive finance unit <b>Dell</b> Financial Services (DFS). These factors position <b>Dell</b>'s business profile in line with higher rated IT hardware providers, such as <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (BBB+/Negative). <b>Dell</b>'s financial structure strengthened considerably, but remains less conservative than those of competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch also assesses the linkage between <b>Dell</b> and 80.4% owned VMware as moderate under Fitch's parent-subsidiary linkage criteria, and therefore equalizes the companies' Long-Term IDRs. VMware is an unrestricted subsidiary in <b>Dell</b>'s credit agreements and indentures, and provides for no upstream guarantees, cross-default provisions, or management or Treasury team overlap. While VMware has an independent related party transaction committee in place, Fitch believes the special dividend in fiscal 2019 to consolidate the VMware tracking stock VMware supports Fitch's assessment of moderate linkage and contingent liquidity for <b>Dell</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth averages in the low single digits through the forecast period with the continuation of PC momentum through the first half of fiscal 2022 and recovery of infrastructure in the second half;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profitability moderates in fiscal 2022, but a higher mix of infrastructure sales sustains <b>Dell</b>'s standalone core EBITDA margins in the high single digits and roughly flat VMware profit margins;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The majority of FCF is used for debt reduction through fiscal 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess <b>Dell</b> cash is used for share repurchases and the company manages debt levels to sustain core leverage of 2.5x-3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater than expected debt reduction from FCF, resulting in the expectation core leverage will be sustained below 3.0x and adjusted FCF (adjusted for the change in financing receivables) to debt below 5.0x in the near term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive revenue growth from profitable market share gains, despite challenging ISG demand dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pre-dividend FCF margin sustained below 2%, from lower than anticipated revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core leverage sustained above 3.5x and FCF (adjusted for the change in financing receivables) to debt approaching the high single digits from weaker than expected profitability or lower than anticipated debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch believes <b>Dell</b>'s liquidity is adequate. As of Oct. 30, 2020, it was supported by $11.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents -- $7.4 billion excluding VMware, the majority of whose cash Fitch considers contingent liquidity. <b>Dell</b>'s undrawn $4.5 billion of first-lien senior secured RCF expiring on December 2023 also supports liquidity, as does Fitch's expectation for $3 billion-$4 billion of <b>Dell</b> standalone adjusted FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch applies a maximum allowable debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 to <b>Dell</b>'s financing receivables to allocate a portion of total debt to DFS, which Fitch excludes from measuring core debt. Fitch similarly excludes DFS profitability from total EBITDA to calculate core EBITDA, as well as the change in financing receivables from FFO in calculating adjusted FCF.</p>

</div><div>1845 words</div><div>16 July 2020</div><div>Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary</div><div>FITRA</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-16 July 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> believes <b>Dell</b> Technology Inc.'s potential spinoff of <span class="companylink">VMware Inc</span>. could result with an investment grade Long-Term (LT) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for VMware, depending upon the amount of debt VMware incurs to fund a dividend to <b>Dell</b> with consideration of any credible 12 to 24 month debt reduction roadmap. Fitch continues to believe VMware's operating profile is in-line with at least a strong 'BBB' but has equalized VMware's LT IDR with that of <b>Dell</b> given our assessment of moderate linkage of the entities under Fitch's PSL criteria. Fitch believes VMware's prior $11 billion special dividend, which funded the majority of <b>Dell</b>'s consolidation of the VMware tracking stock, supports Fitch's moderate linkage assessment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has long maintained that total debt to operating EBITDA of 3.0x is a point of demarcation for investment grade/high yield for healthy businesses and 2.5x is for more challenged business models. Nonetheless, Fitch also focuses on FCF based metrics in assessing an issuer's financial structure, which have been strong and more in-line with an 'A' rating due to VMware's low capital intensity and cash from changes in deferred revenue. These could offset higher than typical EBITDA-based metrics, given VMware's otherwise strong business profile, profitability and financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For <b>Dell</b>, the credit profile impact of a potential spinoff is more nuanced given the aforementioned equalization of <b>Dell</b>'s and VMware's ratings, implying <b>Dell</b>'s standalone IDR would likely be low-'BB' today given standalone credit protection measures. Fitch also believes <b>Dell</b>'s comparatively (to VMware) challenged business model would likely require expectations for core debt (total debt adjusted for finance receivables) to core EBITDA (operating EBITDA adjusted for DFS profitability) sustained closer to 2.5x to achieve an investment grade LT IDR. That said, Fitch believes a sizeable special dividend from VMware used for debt reduction to bring core debt to core EBITDA below 3.5x would result in the affirmation of <b>Dell</b>'s IDR at 'BB+' and revision of the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On July 15, 2020, <b>Dell</b> announced that it is exploring potential alternatives with respect to <b>Dell</b>'s ownership interest in VMware, including a potential tax-free spin-off of its ownership interest in VMware to <b>Dell</b> shareholders. VMware has established a special committee of the board of directors to engage in discussions and negotiations with <b>Dell</b>, which include expectations that VMware will pay a special cash dividend to shareholders, including a pro-rata share to <b>Dell</b>. VMware expects that the special dividend would be partially debt funded within the parameters of maintaining an investment grade LT IDR. <b>Dell</b> would expect to use net proceeds for debt reduction and general corporate purposes with the objective of positioning the company for an investment grade LT IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The discussions would further address the maintenance of mutually beneficial arms-length commercial arrangements that serve mutual customers, including go-to-market, services, research and development and intellectual property agreements. For tax purposes, any potential spinoff would not occur prior to September 2021. In connection with the announcement, VMware extended the authorization of its existing stock repurchase program, which currently has $719 million VMware's Class A common stock remaining, to the end of fiscal 2022 and authorized the repurchase of an additional $1 billion of VMware's Class A common stock, also through the end of fiscal 2022.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-03 April 2020: LEAD PARAGRAPH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has rated the first-lien senior secured notes issuance by <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>. (<b>Dell</b>) subsidiaries and co-issuers of the notes, <b>Dell</b> International LLC and <span class="companylink">EMC Corp</span>., (BBB-/RR1). The notes will be pari passu with <b>Dell</b>'s existing first-lien senior secured debt, which was $44.4 billion pro forma for <b>Dell</b>'s $3 billion draw on its revolving credit facility (RCF). Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including refinancing upcoming debt maturities, although Fitch's ratings and Negatrive Rating Outlook continue to incorporate expectations for <b>Dell</b> to use of all of its FCF for debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The current ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectation that credit protection measures are likely to remain weak for the rating through the near-term despite <b>Dell</b>'s stated intention to prioritize debt reduction with FCF (up to $5.5 billion in the current fiscal year). Fitch forecasts the coronavirus pandemic will result in mid- to high-single digit revenue declines for fiscal 2020, exacerbating the company's prior expectations for near-term margin headwinds and, in conjunction with <b>Dell</b>'s negative working capital model, constraining cash flow. Given heightened risk that available cash will be insufficient to meet the company's current debt reduction target for fiscal 2021, Fitch expects zero near-term share repurchases by <b>Dell</b> under the company's Feb. 28, 2020 $1 billion authorization expiring Feb. 28, 2022. The pending sale of the company's security software business (RSA) for $2.1 billion should use net proceeds (assuming the private equity buyer secures financing), potentially shoring up available cash for debt reduction. Nonetheless, <b>Dell</b>'s core leverage (core debt to core EBITDA), which Fitch estimated at 4.2x exiting fiscal 2020, will remain above Fitch's 3.5x negative rating sensitivity until calendar 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Reduction Priority: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b> will continue prioritizing debt reduction with FCF. The company publicly targeted repaying up to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2021, a seemingly more achievable commitment following the Feb. 18, 2020 announcement of the proposed divestiture of <b>Dell</b>'s <span class="companylink">RSA Security</span> business for $2.1 billion in cash. However, uncertainty surrounding the depth and duration of a coronavirus-driven downturn in at least the first half of fiscal 2021 and magnitude and speed of any subsequent recovery reduces the probability <b>Dell</b> has sufficient near-term debt reduction capacity to achieve its target, even if RSA closes. In Fitch's rating case, lower than previously anticipated profitability will delay the company's ability to return core leverage to below 3.5x until calendar 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong VMware Performance: Fitch expects VMware to continue strong operating performance driven by robust adoption of the company's full infrastructure stack solutions and growing mix of recurring revenue and cash flow from subscription and SaaS and service and support, which increased to two-thirds of total revenue in fiscal 2020. Beyond lower organic growth driven by the coronavirus pandemic, Fitch assumes in fiscal 2021, VMware should grow by mid- to high-single digits overall and generate more than $2.5 billion of average annual FCF by leveraging the company's large and diversified installed base. Fitch credits <b>Dell</b> with 100% of VMware's operating results and financial structure, which continues to benefit <b>Dell</b>'s credit protection measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Secular ISG Headwinds: Fitch believes secular IT hardware spending headwinds will constrain revenue growth for <b>Dell</b>'s ISG segment. The digestion of robust IT hardware spending in fiscal 2018, largely stoked by U.S. tax reform, led to mid-teen revenue declines for <b>Dell</b>'s server and networking businesses in fiscal 2020. Nonetheless, Fitch believes that white boxing within the context of marginal workload migration to the cloud and, therefore, cloud service providers' (CSP) consolidation of IT hardware spending will constrain top-line growth for hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEM), including <b>Dell</b>. The potential for CSPs competing with hardware OEMs by reselling white-boxed products would exacerbate this headwind, although Fitch recognizes CSPs primarily focus white boxing on lower-mix configurations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CSG Outperformance: Fitch's anticipation for the continuation of personal computers (PC) market share gains by the top three PC makers, including <b>Dell</b>, higher mix sales and increasing peripherals and financing attach rates, should drive CSG outperformance. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, <b>Dell</b> anticipated the multi-year Windows 10 refresh cycle will taper shipment volume in the current fiscal year with the normalization of commodity input prices adversely impacting operating profitability after record CSG profit margins in the last fiscal year. While Fitch believes cash flow from CSG underpins the <b>Dell</b>'s debt reduction capacity and will remain solid over the long-term, lower volume shipments and segment profit margin in conjunction with <b>Dell</b>'s negative working capital model could constrain FCF for fiscal 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthening Long-Term Profitability: <b>Dell</b>'s profit margins should strengthen over time with a richer sales mix and increasing attach rates in CSG and faster growth at more profitable VMware offsetting secular pricing pressures in the infrastructure segment. Fitch expects near-term profit margin degradation from lower volume shipments and normalizing commodity prices after printing record Fitch estimated of 11.8% core EBITDA in fiscal 2020 but that core EBITDA margins will remain above 11%, below the company's plan (in connection with the Sept. 7, 2016 acquisition of <span class="companylink">EMC Corp</span>.) but still up more than 100 bps since closing the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b>'s 'BB+' rating reflects the company's significant installed based and strong share positions that have, among other things, resulted in strong cross-selling opportunities across <b>Dell</b>, VMware and <b>Dell</b> Financial Services (DFS). The continuation of CSG market share gains should largely mitigate secular headwinds for IT hardware OEMs more broadly, while strong cash flow from PCs and a richer sales mix from faster growing VMware drive FCF growth. These factors position <b>Dell</b>'s business profile favorably versus higher rated IT hardware providers such as <span class="companylink">Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</span> (rated 'BBB+' with a Stable Rating Outlook by Fitch). However, <b>Dell</b>'s financial structure remains weak for the current rating as the company continues an extended path of deleveraging after the aggressively financed <span class="companylink">EMC</span> acquisition. Deleveraging has been delayed in part by initial underperformance by the legacy <span class="companylink">EMC</span> portfolio and a debt funded sweetener of <b>Dell</b>'s consolidation of the then existing VMware tracking stock in December 2018, resulting in Fitch's revision of the Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch also assesses the linkage between <b>Dell</b> and 80.9% owned VMware as moderate under Fitch's parent-subsidiary linkage criteria and, therefore, equalizes the companies' long-term Issuer Default Ratings. VMware is an unrestricted subsidiary in <b>Dell</b>'s credit agreements and indentures and provide for no upstream guarantees, cross-default provisions or management or treasury team overlap. While VMware has an independent related party transaction committee in place, Fitch believes the special dividend in fiscal 2019 to consolidate the VMware tracking stock VMware supports Fitch's assessment of moderate linkage and contingent liquidity for <b>Dell</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects revenue down by the mid- to high-single digits in fiscal 2021, driven by depressed demand related to the coronavirus meaningfully more than offsetting a temporary surge in infrastructure spending (laptops, servers and networking);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch's rating case incorporates a partial recovery in <b>Dell</b>'s second half of the current fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2021 and low growth through full recovery exiting fiscal 2022, driven in part by the very near-term pull-forward of demand;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Weak (slightly up to slightly down) top-line growth through the remainder of the forecast period with robust VMware growth offsetting secular headwinds for servers and storage from white boxing and disintermediation, respectively, while PC share gains largely offset the end of the Win10 upgrade cycle;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Near-term profitability modestly contracts from a higher mix of VMware and infrastructure revenue mostly offsetting headwinds from lower volume and the normalization of commodity input prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Dell</b> uses all of its FCF, as well as net proceeds from the RSA transaction, for debt reduction rather than executing on the Board of Director's Feb. 20, 2020 $1 billion Class C common stock repurchase authorization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch could stabilize the ratings if it expects core debt to core EBITDA sustained at or below 3.5x in the near-term or take incremental positive rating action if we expect core debt to core EBITDA sustained below 3x and core debt to adjusted FCF (adjusted for the change in financing receivables) below 5x in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive organic revenue growth from profitable market share gains, despite Fitch's expectation for secular demand challenges, including structurally lower enterprise spending on IT hardware and increased white boxing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pre-dividend FCF margin sustained below 2%, from lower than anticipated revenue;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core debt to core EBITDA sustained above 3.5x and core debt to FCF (adjusted for the change in financing receivables) approaching the high single digits from lower than anticipated debt reduction or weaker than expected profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings please visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579]..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b>'s liquidity will remain adequate and, as of Jan. 31, 2020, consisted of: i) $6.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents ($9.3 billion of total cash and cash equivalents less $2.9 billion held by VMware) and ii) an undrawn $4.5 billion first-lien senior secured RCF expiring 2021 (under which the company drew down $3 billion in March 2020, leaving $1.5 billion of availability under the facility). Fitch's expectation for roughly $2.5 billion of annual FCF (excluding VMware) also supports liquidity, as does contingent liquidity at VMware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> faces manageable maturities this calendar year, which aside from mandatory term loan amortization includes: i) $600 million of 2.65% legacy senior notes due June 1, 2020, ii) $1.25 billion of 2.3% VMware senior notes due August 2020, and iii) $1.5 billion of VMware 364-day term loan. Debt maturities in 2021 step-up and, aside from mandatory amortization, include: i) $400 million of 4.625% legacy senior unsecured notes due April 2021, ii) $4.5 billion of 4.42% first-lien secured notes due June 2021, and iii) $1.1 billion of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due June 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch applies a maximum allowable debt to equity ratio of 3:1 to <b>Dell</b>'s financing receivables to allocate a portion of total debt to DFS, which Fitch excludes from measuring core debt. Similarly, Fitch excludes DFS profitability from total EBITDA to calculate core EBITDA, as well as the change in financing receivables from FFO in calculating adjusted FCF.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-02 April 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the ratings, including the 'BB+' long-term issuer default ratings (IDR), for <span class="companylink"><b>Dell</b> Technologies, Inc</span>. (<b>Dell</b>) and its subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook Remains Negative. Fitch's actions affect $57.2 billion of total debt, including the $4.5 billion 1st-lien senior secured revolving credit facility (RCF).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and outlook reflect Fitch's expectation that credit protection measures are likely to remain weak for the rating through the near-term despite <b>Dell</b>'s stated intention to prioritize debt reduction with FCF (up to $5.5 billion in the current fiscal year). Fitch forecasts the coronavirus will result in mid- to high-single digit revenue declines for fiscal 2020 exacerbating the company's prior expectations for near-term margin headwinds and, in conjunction with <b>Dell</b>'s negative working capital model, constraining cash flow. The pending sale of the company's security software business (RSA) for $2.1 billion should net use net proceeds (assuming the private equity buyer secures financing), potentially shoring up available cash for debt reduction. Nonetheless, <b>Dell</b>'s core leverage (core debt to core EBITDA), which Fitch estimated at 4.2x exiting fiscal 2020, will remain above Fitch's 3.5x negative rating sensitivity until calendar 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Reduction Priority: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b> will continue prioritizing debt reduction with FCF. The company publicly targeted repaying up to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2021, a seemingly more achievable commitment following the Feb. 18, 2020 announcement of the proposed divestiture of <b>Dell</b>'s <span class="companylink">RSA Security</span> business for $2.1 billion in cash. However, uncertainty surrounding the depth and duration of a coronavirus-driven downturn in at least the first half of fiscal 2021 and magnitude and speed of any subsequent recovery reduces the probability <b>Dell</b> has sufficient near-term debt reduction capacity to achieve its target, even if RSA closes. In Fitch's rating case, lower than previously anticipated profitability will delay the company's ability to return core leverage to below 3.5x until calendar 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong VMware Performance: Fitch expects VMware to continue strong operating performance driven by robust adoption of the company's full infrastructure stack solutions and growing mix of recurring revenue and cash flow from subscription and SaaS and service and support, which increased to two-thirds of total revenue in fiscal 2020. Beyond coronavirus-driven lower organic growth Fitch assumes in fiscal 2021, VMware should grow by mid- to high-single digits overall and generate more than $2.5 billion of average annual FCF by leveraging the company's large and diversified installed base. Fitch credits <b>Dell</b> with 100% of VMware's operating results and financial structure, which continues to benefit <b>Dell</b>'s credit protection measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Secular ISG Headwinds: Fitch believes secular IT hardware spending headwinds will constrain revenue growth for <b>Dell</b>'s ISG segment. The digestion of robust IT hardware spending in fiscal 2018, largely stoked by U.S. tax reform, led to mid-teen revenue declines for <b>Dell</b>'s server and networking businesses in fiscal 2020. Nonetheless, Fitch believes that white boxing within the context of marginal workload migration to the cloud and, therefore, cloud service providers' (CSP) consolidation of IT hardware spending will constrain top line growth for hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEM), including <b>Dell</b>. The potential for CSPs competing with hardware OEMs by reselling white boxed products would exacerbate this headwind, although Fitch recognizes CSPs primarily focus white boxing on lower-mix configurations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CSG Outperformance: Fitch's anticipation for the continuation of personal computers (PC) market share gains by the top three PC makers, including <b>Dell</b>, higher mix sales and increasing peripherals and financing attach rates should drive CSG outperformance. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, <b>Dell</b> anticipated the multi-year Windows 10 refresh cycle will taper shipment volume in the current fiscal year with the normalization of commodity input prices adversely impacting operating profitability after record CSG profit margins last fiscal year. While Fitch believes cash flow from CSG underpins the <b>Dell</b>'s debt reduction capacity and will remain solid over the long-term, lower volume shipments and segment profit margin in conjunction with <b>Dell</b>'s negative working capital model could constrain FCF for fiscal 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strengthening Long-Term Profitability: <b>Dell</b>'s profit margins should strengthen over time with a richer sales mix and increasing attach rates in CSG and faster growth at more profitable VMware offsetting secular pricing pressures in the infrastructure segment. Fitch expects near-term profit margin degradation from lower volume shipments and normalizing commodity prices after printing record Fitch estimated of 11.8% core EBITDA in fiscal 2020 but that core EBITDA margins will remain above 11%, below the company's plan (in connection with the Sept. 7, 2016 acquisition of <span class="companylink">EMC Corp</span>.) but still up more than 100 basis points since closing the deal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Near-term profitability modestly contracts from a higher mix of VMware and infrastructure revenue mostly offsetting headwinds from lower volume and the normalization of commodity input prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Dell</b> uses all of its FCF, as well as net proceeds from the RSA transaction, for debt reduction rather than executing on the Board of Director's February 20, 2020 $1 billion Class C common stock repurchase authorization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch could stabilize the ratings if it expects core debt to core EBITDA sustained at or below 3.5x in the near-term or take incremental positive rating action if we expect core debt to core EBITDA sustained below 3x and core debt to adjusted FCF (adjusted for the change in financing receivables) below 5x in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive organic revenue growth from profitable market share gains, despite Fitch's expectation for secular demand challenges, including structurally lower enterprise spending on IT hardware and increased white boxing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pre-dividend FCF margin sustained below 2%, from lower than anticipated revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for core debt to core EBITDA sustained above 3.5x and core debt to FCF (adjusted for the change in financing receivables) approaching the high single digits from lower than anticipated debt reduction or weaker than expected profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenarios Non-Financial Corporate:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Dell</b>'s liquidity will remain adequate and, as of January 31, 2020, consisted of: i) $6.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents ($9.3 billion of total cash and cash equivalents less $2.9 billion held by VMware) and ii) an undrawn $4.5 billion 1st-lien senior secured RCF expiring 2021 (under which the company drew down $3 billion in March 2020, leaving $1.5 billion of availability under the facility). Fitch's expectation for roughly $2.5 billion of annual FCF (excluding VMware) also supports liquidity, as does contingent liquidity at VMware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Dell</b> faces manageable maturities this calendar year, which aside from mandatory term loan amortization includes: i) $600 million of 2.65% legacy senior notes due June 1, 2020, ii) $1.25 billion of 2.3% VMware senior notes due August 2020, and iii) $1.5 billion of VMware 364-day term loan. Debt maturities in 2021 step-up and, aside from mandatory amortization, include: i) $400 million of 4.625% legacy senior unsecured notes due April 2021, ii) $4.5 billion of 4.42% 1st-lien secured notes due June 2021, and iii) $1.1 billion of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due June 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch applies a maximum allowable debt to equity ratio of 3:1 to <b>Dell</b>'s financing receivables to allocate a portion of total debt to DFS, which Fitch excludes from measuring core debt. Similarly, Fitch excludes DFS profitability from total EBITDA to calculate core EBITDA, as well as the change in financing receivables from FFO in calculating adjusted FCF.</p>

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>
