<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-19 May 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has placed the 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span>, <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>, Time Warner Cable, LLC, and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC, the 'BBB-' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR1' senior secured debt ratings, and the 'BB+'/'RR4' senior unsecured debt ratings on Rating Watch Positive (RWP).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The RWP reflects the anticipated change in structure and leverage upon its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Cox Communications, Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable Rating Outlook). Based on the proposed combined capital structure, Charter will materially enhance its operational scale while lowering its total leverage. Charter has announced a substantial reduction in its target leverage range from 4.0x-4.5x to a new range of 3.5x-4.0x, which is expected to be reached within two to three years of the deal closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The transaction is expected to close in 2026, taking over six months. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will resolve the Rating Watch at that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Cox</span> Improves Charter's Leading Position: The addition of <span class="companylink">Cox</span> expands Charter's scale benefits as the largest U.S. multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD), with a combined pro forma 37.6 million total customer relationships, surpassing the domestic customer count of <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> (A-/Stable). This addition increases Charter's size as the largest U.S. linear video distribution provider with a combined pro forma 14.4 million subscribers. Charter's operating strategies have resulted in relatively lower customer losses compared to the overall industry for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Lower Leverage Range Enhances Credit: The acquisition of <span class="companylink">Cox</span> includes $11.9 billion of equity consideration and, when adjusted for anticipated synergies, is expected to result in a net reduction to current leverage levels. Furthermore, given the substantial amount of total pro forma debt, approximately $111 billion on the combined entity, management has reduced its long-held target leverage range to 3.5x-4.0x from 4.0x-4.5x, which is expected to be realized within two to three years after the deal is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operating, Capex Synergies Drive FCF: Management has guided to approximately $500 million in operating cost synergies, which should drive an increase in the growth trajectory of EBITDA within several years post-closing. This expected EBITDA growth, coupled with lower overall capex as Charter's current expansion and network evolution initiatives are expected to be largely completed by 2027, should accelerate pro forma free cash flow growth thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Wireless Acceleration: <span class="companylink">Cox</span>'s mobile offering is still in its early stages, while Charter's mobile offering has enjoyed significant success, growing to more than 10 million lines. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the ability for Charter management to accelerate their mobile offering across <span class="companylink">Cox</span>'s footprint will likely accelerate growth and reduce churn in the coming quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter Product Packaging Benefits: In September 2024, Charter launched Life Unlimited, an industry commitment to offer reliable connectivity, same-day on-site technical service, transparent pricing and service updates, and product refunds for inadequate service and support. Life Unlimited offers two products: (i) a two-year price lock for internet and mobile or internet and video services (two lines of mobile required) and (ii) a three-year price lock for internet and mobile and video services. Expanding this customer initiative throughout the <span class="companylink">Cox</span> footprint is expected to reduce churn and increase the number of new broadband subscribers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Expansion of Leadership in Video: Charter leads the industry with innovative new carriage agreements with major programmers like <span class="companylink">The Walt Disney Company</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.</span> (BBB-/Stable), offering video subscribers access to ad-supported direct-to-consumer (DTC) platforms at no extra cost. These agreements add up to approximately $80 in value for customers. Expanding these carriage arrangements across the Cox footprint should help stabilize its video segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. It is the largest U.S. cable MVPD with 31.4 million total customer relationships and the largest U.S. linear video content distributor with 12.7 million customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> is rated higher than Charter, primarily due to its lower target leverage and actual total leverage as well as its significantly greater revenue, coverage area and segment diversification. DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC (BB/Stable) may lack Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and FCF levels, but has lower leverage and greater geographic diversification. <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T Corp.</span>'s 70% economic ownership after its spin-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter plans to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity from EBITDA, maintaining a target leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x, with company guidance to a tighter range of 4.0x-4.25x until the close of the <span class="companylink">Cox</span> transaction. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity to be used for shareholder returns, along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue over the rating period is expected to be relatively flat as wireless growth offsets near-term broadband pressures and continued declines in the video and voice segments. Expect broadband to begin adding subscribers in 2025 after the Affordable Connectivity Program (<span class="companylink">ACP</span>) roll-off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA growth slows but margins improve slightly, driven by wireless platform improvement;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex will remain elevated in 2025 but begin to decline meaningfully beginning in 2026 due to completion of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) line extensions in 2026, two years ahead of schedule, and the expectation of major network evolution spending to be completed by 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is expected to more than double from approximately $4.3 billion in 2024 to nearly $10 billion in 2028. Annual FCF generation is expected to more than cover annual debt maturities during the rating period. The company is expected to continue using the bulk of its FCF generation for share repurchase activity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter is expected to remain opportunistic in the capital markets to refinance near-term maturities, with potential additional issuance to fund shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's instrument ratings and Recovery Ratings (RRs) are assigned in accordance with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria." Under its generic approach for rating instruments of companies in the 'BB' rating category, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notches instruments against the IDR and assigns RRs according to generic recovery assumptions derived from historical performance data based on security and relative priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For 'BB' category U.S. issuers with no major features that may limit recovery, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notches first-lien debt up to two notches from the IDR, with a cap of 'BBB-', due to the significant recovery percentages associated with an 'RR1'. Charter's senior secured issuance is assigned a 'BBB-' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR1' and benefits from a one-notch uplift from the IDR, given its first-priority security position and the 'BBB-' cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >If Charter's IDR were upgraded to 'BBB-', the senior secured debt could be upgraded to 'BBB' depending on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of collateral quality, and the unsecured debt could be upgraded to 'BBB-', depending on the level of contractual or structural subordination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >If Charter's IDR were downgraded to 'BB', the senior secured debt is likely to remain 'BBB-', assuming there are no material changes to the security package or increases in the senior secured debt or other considerations <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers when deciding between RR1 and RR2 for first lien debt of 'BB' category issuers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Weakening of its competitive position, as measured by accelerated broadband subscriber losses;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--(CFO-capex)/debt not approaching 5.0% as the company's planned capex is completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained over 5.0x, possibly related to a more aggressive financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--(CFO-capex)/debt exceeding 10% on a sustained basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and believes it will improve in line with continued FCF growth. The company's liquidity position as of March 31, 2025, included approximately $796 million in cash and $6.4 billion available under its two revolvers: $960 million maturing in August 2027 and $5.5 billion maturing in March 2030 after accounting for the drawn amount and letters of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2028 are manageable, with $2.1 billion due in 2025, $2.2 billion in 2026, $3.6 billion in 2027, and $5.4 billion in 2028, inclusive of required term loan amortization. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance a significant portion of these upcoming maturities in line with its historical actions. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates that Charter could choose to pay off all these maturities with expected internal free cash flow generation if necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is the largest U.S. cable MVPD and the second-largest broadband connectivity company in the U.S. As of year-end 2024, Charter had LTM revenue of approximately $55.1 billion and EBITDA of $22.6 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-06 February 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span> (Charter), <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span> (CCO), <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (CCOH), Time Warner Cable, LLC (TWC), and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (TWCE). The ratings reflect Charter's consistent leading position as the largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) and the second-largest broadband connectivity company in the U.S.. The ratings also reflect its relatively successful operational efforts and relative leverage. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's instrument and recovery ratings (RR) are assigned in accordance with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria". Senior secured debt issued by CCO, TWC and TWCE were rated 'BBB-' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR1'. Structurally subordinated senior unsecured debt issued by CCOH were assigned a 'BB+'/'RR4' rating. More details on the secured issue level ratings are available in the liquidity and debt structure section below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter enjoys significant scale benefits as the largest U.S. MVPD, with 31.5 million total customer relationships as of Dec. 31, 2024, just behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> (A-/Stable). It became the largest U.S. linear video distribution provider with 12.9 million customers by Dec. 31, 2024, surpassing <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> in 4Q23. Charter's operating strategies have resulted in relatively lower customer losses compared to the overall industry for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Stable Credit Profile: As of Dec. 31, 2024, Charter had approximately $93.8 billion in debt, including $66.5 billion in senior secured debt. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated gross leverage was 4.2x, within negative rating sensitivities, and secured leverage was 3.0x. Charter plans to continue opportunistically refinancing near-term maturities and may issue additional debt to fund shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth. Total leverage is expected to approach the lower end of the company's 4.0x-4.5x targeted leverage range over the rating period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF Growth Expected to Accelerate: FCF is expected to benefit from reduced capex during the rating period, potentially doubling from approximately $4.3 billion in 2024 to nearly $10 billion in 2028. Annual FCF generation is expected to more than cover annual debt maturities during the rating period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >"Life Unlimited" Expected to Boost Churn and Subscriber Growth: In September 2024, Charter launched "Life Unlimited, " a unique cable industry commitment offering fully reliable connectivity, same-day on-site technical service, transparent pricing and service updates, exceptional support service or product refunds, and continuous improvements of network capacity. It includes a two-year price lock for broadband bundles and a three-year price lock for mobile services. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects this initiative to create a differentiated customer experience, reducing churn and increase new broadband subscribers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Segment Poised to Return to Positive Net Additions: Charter had approximately five million broadband subscribers benefitting from the <span class="companylink">ACP</span>, a federal subsidy program that ended in May 2024. Charter successfully retained approximately 90% of these subscribers on new plans. With the <span class="companylink">ACP</span> impact diminishing, Charter is expected to resume modest growth in broadband subscribers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Video Segment Expected to Stabilize: Charter leads the industry with innovative new carriage agreements with major programmers like <span class="companylink">Disney</span> and Warner Bros., offering video subscribers access to ad-supported DTC platforms at no extra cost. These agreements add up to almost $80 in value for customers. Although not expect to grow the video subscriber base, they should reduce churn in this segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liberty Broadband Acquisition Expected to be Leverage-neutral: Charter's planned acquisition of <span class="companylink">Liberty Broadband</span>, its largest Charter shareholder with approximately 26% equity, is on-track to close in the first half of 2027. <span class="companylink">Liberty Broadband</span> holds $2.62 billion in debt linked to its Charter stock. Charter's $100 million monthly share repurchase plan aims to reduce this outstanding debt balance, keeping the acquisition leverage-neutral at closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space, given its size and geographic diversity. It is the largest U.S. cable MVPD with 31.5 million total customer relationships and is largest U.S. linear video content distributor with 12.9 million customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> is rated higher than Charter, primarily due to its lower target leverage and actual total leverage, and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC (BB/Stable) may lack Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and FCF levels, but has lower leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T Corp.</span>'s 70% economic ownership after its spin-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings remain stable as the company plans to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity from EBITDA, maintaining a target leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue over the rating period is expected to be relatively flat as wireless growth offsets near-term broadband pressures and continued declines in the video and voice segments. Expect broadband to begin to start adding subscribers in 2025 as the <span class="companylink">ACP</span> roll-off is complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA growth slows but margins improve slightly, driven by wireless platform improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex will remain elevated in 2025 but begin to decline meaningfully beginning in 2026 due to an expected slowdown in new line extensions and the expectation of major network evolution spending to be completed by 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is expected to more than double from approximately $4.3 billion in 2024 to nearly $10 billion in 2028. Annual FCF generation is expected to more than cover annual debt maturities during the rating period. The company is expected to continue using the bulk of its FCF generation for share repurchase activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter is expected to remain opportunistic in the capital markets to refinance near-term maturities, with potential additional issuance to fund shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth. Total leverage is expected to approach the lower end of the company's 4.0x-4.5x leverage range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Weakening of its competitive position, as measured by accelerated broadband subscriber losses;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--(CFO-capex)/debt not approaching 5.0% as the company's planned capex is completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained over 5.0x, possibly related to a more aggressive financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--(CFO-capex)/debt exceeding 10% on a sustained basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and believes it will improve in line with the continued FCF growth. The company's liquidity position at Dec. 31, 2024 included approximately $459 million of cash and $6.32 billion available under its two revolvers; $960 million maturing in August 2027 and $5.5 billion maturing in March 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2028 are manageable, with $2.1 billion due in 2025, $2.2 billion in 2026, $3.6 billion in 2027, and $5.4 billion in 2028, inclusive of required term loan amortization. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance a significant portion of these upcoming maturities in line with its historical actions. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates Charter could choose to pay off all of these maturities with expected internal free cash generation if necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> and CCOH. CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt and all of its existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's, TWC's and TWCE's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis for Issuers Rated 'BB-' or Above: Charter's instrument ratings and RRs are assigned in accordance with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria". Under its generic approach for rating instruments of companies in the 'BB' rating category, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notches instruments against the IDR and assigns RRs according to generic recovery assumptions derived from historical performance data based on security and relative priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For 'BB' category U.S. issuers with no major features that may limit recovery, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notches first-lien debt up to two notches from the IDR, with a cap of 'BBB-', due to the significant recovery percentages associated with an RR1. Charter's senior secured issuance is assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' and benefits from a one-notch uplift from the IDR, given its first-priority security position and the 'BBB-' cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >If Charter's IDR were downgraded to 'BB', the senior secured debt is likely to remain 'BBB-', assuming there are no material changes to the security package, increase in the senior secured debt or other considerations <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers when deciding between RR1 and RR2 for first lien debt of 'BB' category issuers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is expected to continue combining a significant portion of its robust FCF with debt issuance, using capacity created by EBITDA growth for shareholder returns.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-30 January 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-' rating and Recovery Rating of 'RR1' to DIRECTV Financing LLC's proposed $750 million senior secured term loan offering and proposed $1,750 million senior secured notes due in 2031. The senior secured notes are issued by DIRECTV Financing, LLC and co-issued by DIRECTV Financing Co-Obligor, Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The net proceeds from the combined $2,500 million in secured debt will used to pay a dividend of $1,625 million to <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and <span class="companylink">TPG</span> in the proportion of their current ownership, and the remaining proceeds of $875 million will be used to refinance the 2027 maturities in part, and pay related fees and expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Large Scale: <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>'s video subscriber base is the third largest traditional multi-channel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. with about 9.7 million subscribers at the end of 3Q24. It follows <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span> with about 13 million and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> with about 12.8 million video subscribers. <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> remains the largest on a video-only revenue basis, but has no broadband or other operations like its peers. Scale is crucial for MVPD operators as it provides greater negotiating power with content providers and TV broadcasters, helping to manage costs amid secular pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Conservative Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA leverage of approximately 1.6x at YE 2024, and approximately 2.0x at YE 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects leverage to increase in 2025, largely due to the expected additional debt assumption to fund the $1,625 million dividend payment to <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and <span class="companylink">TPG</span> and continued decline in EBITDA. <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>'s ratings reflect its commitment to remain conservatively capitalized within its stated target leverage of 1.5x to 2x leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Flexibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF will approximate a billion a year, after tax distributions and excluding a one-time dividend impact in 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes slightly higher capex for potential satellite replacements by decade's end. FCF is supported by low capex of 2%-3% and a shifting product mix. <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> via Internet and Stream have low subscriber acquisition costs. The equipment cost is lower, and the product generally does not require a truck roll as customers can self-install the equipment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also expects continued dividends on common equity to <span class="companylink">TPG</span> as long as it remains within its stated target range. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> to fully redeem <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>'s common catch up equity in 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>'s Exit Eliminates Notching Uplift: DIRECTV's 'BB' Issuer Default Rating reflects its standalone credit profile. With <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>'s proposed exit from the <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> joint venture with <span class="companylink">TPG</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> no longer provides a one-notch uplift benefit to <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>'s ratings. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> historically linked DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC's IDR to <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>'s intention to exit the JV results in low strategic incentives for <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>. Combined with low legal and operational incentives, this leads <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> to assess <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> on a standalone basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Declining Industry Trends: Secular pressures have resulted in declining subscribers of traditional linear television, including satellite pay-TV, due to shifting consumer preferences and technology changes. The video industry has rapidly evolved over the last few years, with direct to consumer (DTCs) platforms such <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> and <span class="companylink">Disney</span>+ amassing significant subscribers. This has led to material subscriber losses in traditional video distributors. Additionally, the growth in broadband accessibility and speeds makes it easier for over the top (OTT) platforms to provide streaming services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>'s publicly rated MVPD peers include <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span> (BB+/Stable). <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> is rated higher than <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> primarily due to significantly greater revenue size and segment diversification. With under 10 million subscribers through the DIRECTV satellite TV, <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> via Stream, <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> via Internet and U-verse offerings, <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> is the third largest U.S. MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> and Charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> is more weakly positioned given its less competitive product offering. This has disadvantaged it relative to MVPD peers, which benefit from their ability to use bundling (mainly broadband services) to retain video subscribers. Charter's ratings also benefit from segment diversification, scale and higher FCF that is balanced against higher leverage metrics (near 4.5x) compared <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>'s metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues are expected to decline in the high single digits in 2025 primarily due to declines in <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> satellite subscribers and U-Verse subscribers, partly offset by higher ARPUs across all three platforms;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins are expected to be in the low-to-mid 20 percent range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated FCF (after tax distributions) is expected to be in $400 million-$500 million deficit in 2025 due to $1,625 million dividend to owners, and approximate $1 billion annually over the 2026-2027, with capex intensity in the low single digits;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes the company applies discretionary cash flow beyond the term loan amortization to additional debt repayments to maintain leverage;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">AT&T</span> remaining common catch-up redemption in 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Prolonged declines in revenue and EBITDA, not offset by reductions in debt, leading to EBITDA leverage of 3x or greater;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage greater than 3x due to leveraging transactions, particularly without a credible deleveraging plan, or a more aggressive financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Successful execution on initiatives to return to revenue/EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage maintained at 2x or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>'s liquidity is supported by cash on hand and strong FCFs. There was no availability under the revolving credit facility as of Sept. 30, 2024. The principal financial covenant in the RCF is a 2.25x springing first lien net leverage ratio, if the RCF is more than 35% drawn. FCF will be supported by low capex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As of Sept. 30, 2024, <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>'s capital structure consisted of approx. $4.5 billion of senior secured notes, a $2.2 billion first lien term loan, a $500 million revolving credit facility (of which $468 million was drawn) and $73 million outstanding of rolled over unsecured notes at <span class="companylink">DIRECTV Holdings, LLC</span>. The debt is issued at DIRECTV Financing, LLC (with DIRECTV Financing Co-Obligor, Inc. as co-issuer on notes) and is guaranteed by DIRECTV Financing HoldCo, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>. The proposed senior secured offerings will extend roughly $840 million of the 2027 maturities to 2031.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company also has a three-year accounts receivable securitization facility due in 2025 with up to $500 million of availability. The facility had $427 million outstanding at Sept. 30, 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will keep rolling over the accounts-receivable facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> provides video entertainment services, consisting of the <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> direct to home satellite business, U-verse video and DIRECTV Stream. The company is owned 70% by <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and 30% by <span class="companylink">TPG</span>, but jointly controlled by both.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-12 April 2024: This is a correction of a release published on Feb. 21, 2024. It updates the Rating Sensitivities for <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span>
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span> (Charter), <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span> (CCO), <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (CCOH), Time Warner Cable, LLC (TWC) and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (TWCE). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed the 'BBB-'/'RR1' senior secured ratings for instruments at CCO, TWC, and TWCE, and the 'BB+'/'RR4' senior unsecured ratings for instruments at CCOH. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The IDRs are driven by Charter's consistent leading position as the second-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. and relatively successful operational efforts along with Charter's relative leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter enjoys significant scale benefits as the second largest U.S. MVPD with 32.1 million total customer relationships at Dec. 31, 2023, just behind Comcast Corp. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Charter became the largest U.S. linear video distribution provider with 14.1 million customers as its operating strategies have resulted in generally lower relative customer losses than the overall industry for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's consistent leading position in U.S. linear video distribution allowed it to negotiate favorable programming carriage terms with <span class="companylink">The Walt Disney Company</span> during FY2023, something <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to largely replicate in upcoming carriage agreements with other content providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Revenue and EBITDA for the FYE Dec. 31, 2023 totaled $54.6 billion and $21.9 billion, respectively, largely in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Charter had approximately $97.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $70.3 billion of senior secured debt. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated FYE Dec. 31, 2023 gross leverage was 4.6x, well within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s negative rating sensitivities, while secured leverage was 3.3x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operating Momentum: Charter focuses on a market share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance its service offerings' overall competitiveness, while effectively managing costs. As a result, revenues increased to $54.6 billion for the FYE ended Dec. 31, 2023 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 4.6% six-year CAGR, while margins improved by approximately 330 bps to 40.1%. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects near-term growth to continue to slow as Charter works to offset increasing competitive pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) became Charter's largest product segment in 2020 as consumers became increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities during the pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects broadband growth will be challenging over the next two years, but will continue to offset the expected continued industrywide basic video subscriber declines, while also benefiting margins and FCF, given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity. Wireless is expected to see continued growth and eventually offset related infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Performance: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects near-term broadband revenues to be compressed by 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) competition and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s low expectations for the renewal of the Affordable Connectivity Program's (<span class="companylink">ACP</span>) funding. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter's broadband revenues to be slightly down to flat over the next two years. Although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects broadband to generate low single digit growth in 2026 and beyond, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will closely monitor Charter's relative performance over the next 12-18 months to consider the potential for larger operational issues for Charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FWA has become the disruptor <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expected, pressuring broadband sub growth across the cable industry. After navigating this threat early, Charter's lost 61 thousand broadband subscribers in 4Q23 (off a base of more than 30 million) due primarily to FWA promotional activities. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes FWA will remain a competitive threat as broadband customers continue to lean into FWA's lower priced offerings. However, Charter's near-term planned investment in its hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) network will enhance broadband speeds through the provision of bundled home broadband, advanced Wi-Fi and mobile lines, which should enhance its competitive position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter has approximately five million broadband subscribers benefitting from the <span class="companylink">ACP</span>, a federal program designed to bridge the broadband internet access digital divide by providing subsidies to qualifying households. Program funding runs out in April 2024 and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes there is a low probability for renewal given the current political landscape. However, Charter noted most subscribers benefitting from <span class="companylink">ACP</span> were customers before its inception, as Charter had been providing broadband access to economically challenged customers since before the pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to work aggressively to retain as many subscribers as possible if funding is not renewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mobile Offering: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes Charter's mobile service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. To bolster network capabilities and connectivity, further reduce its dependency on its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc.</span>, and drive margin improvement, Charter continues to build out and deploy its Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash Generating Capacity and Uses: Charter converts more than 25% of revenues to FCF before capex, creating significant capacity for internal (capex) and external (shareholder returns) uses. Management recently updated its capex expectations through FY2027, including updated timing around increased spending on line extensions and network evolution that began in FY2023 and will continue into FY2026 but excluding potential spending associated with the Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. During that period, Charter's CFO less capex/debt percentage decreases to the low-single digits (3.2% at Dec. 31, 2023) before returning to its historical mid-single percentage levels by FY2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the capex ramp up positively. The line extensions provide fallow ground for new customer conversion with less robust competition. In addition, a significant portion of the buildout cost will be covered by RDOF funds. The upgrades to its <span class="companylink">HFC</span> network will cover 100% of its footprint with capex allocation centered on market and customer demographics along with the scale of competitive threats. Despite the aggregate amount of upgrade capex spent, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter's scale and market concentration to keep upgrade costs at approximately $100 per household passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter will continue to maximize shareholder returns by coupling FCF with debt capacity created by EBITDA growth to remain at the high end of its net leverage target of 4.0x-4.5x. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA growth to slow over the rating horizon, thereby constraining new debt capacity creation. Coupled with Charter's increased allocation to capex, this results in lower shareholder returns over the next three years before moving towards historical levels in FY2027. Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $170 million of its class A common stock and <span class="companylink">CCH</span> common units as of Dec. 31, 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings Linked: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating approach equalizes the IDRs across Charter's corporate structure, comprising Charter, CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE, in accordance with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD with 32.1 million total customer relationships and largest U.S. linear video content distributor with 14.1 million customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) is rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. Although DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC (BB+/Stable) lacks Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and FCF levels, it has lower closing leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T Corp.</span>'s 70% economic ownership after its spin-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings are held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining at the high end of its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--For 2024, total revenues are relatively flat as wireless and advertising growth offset broadband pressures and continued declines in the video and voice segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Thereafter, total revenues grow in the low single digits. Wireless growth continues, albeit at a declining pace given the increased base. Broadband eventually returns to low single digit growth as the company benefits from ARPU growth and footprint expansion. Video and voice decline mid-single digits annually as price increases are unable to fully offset mid-single-digit subscriber declines;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA growth slows but margins improve slightly driven by wireless platform improvement;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex will be elevated over the next three years, in line with management expectations. This is driven by network upgrades with a focus on enhancing upstream capacity, an upgrade to DOCSIS 4.0 and efforts to bolster wireless network capabilities and connectivity along with footprint expansion focusing on edge and rural buildouts, with a portion of the latter offset by RDOF funding. Capital intensity is expected to increase to the low 20% range over that time before returning to the mid-teens by FY2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF troughs in the low $2 billion range in 2024 before growing to more than $7.0 billion by 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund near-term maturities, with additional issuance to fund shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--M&A activity is excluded, given the lack of transformational acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not anticipate positive rating momentum over the near term given the company's stated focus on maintaining net leverage at the high end of its 4.0x to 4.5x target range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Weakening of its competitive position as measured by accelerated broadband subscriber losses;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Failure of its operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth and strengthening operating margins;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--(CFO-Capex)/debt not approaching 5.0% as the company's planned Capex investment is completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated leverage sustained over 5.0x, possibly related to a more aggressive financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and that it will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF. The company's liquidity position at Dec. 31, 2023 included approximately $709 million of cash and approximately $3.2 billion of availability under its $5.5 billion revolver which matures in August 2027 (<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes Charter's January 2024 redemption of $2 billion of notes maturing during 2024 were funded with revolver drawings).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2026 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $0.4 billion is due in 2024, $5.2 billion in 2025, and $2.2 billion in 2026. Although maturities increase to $11 billion in 2027, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance a significant portion of the remainder over the next three years in line with historical actions. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $1.5 billion in 2037 to $6.5 billion in 2031. Required term loan amortization and maturities total $390 million in 2024, $700 million in 2025, $387 million in 2026 and $7.7 billion in 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is expected to continue combining a significant portion of its robust FCF with debt issuance using capacity created by EBITDA growth for shareholder returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> rates <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span>, <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>, <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, Inc.</span> and Time Warner Cable Enterprises, LLC, which are all indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-21 February 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc.</span> (Charter), <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span> (CCO), <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (CCOH), Time Warner Cable, LLC (TWC) and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (TWCE). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed the 'BBB-'/'RR1' senior secured ratings for instruments at CCO, TWC, and TWCE, and the 'BB+'/'RR4' senior unsecured ratings for instruments at CCOH. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The IDRs are driven by Charter's consistent leading position as the second-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. and relatively successful operational efforts along with Charter's relative leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter enjoys significant scale benefits as the second largest U.S. MVPD with 32.1 million total customer relationships at Dec. 31, 2023, just behind Comcast Corp. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Charter became the largest U.S. linear video distribution provider with 14.1 million customers as its operating strategies have resulted in generally lower relative customer losses than the overall industry for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's consistent leading position in U.S. linear video distribution allowed it to negotiate favorable programming carriage terms with <span class="companylink">The Walt Disney Company</span> during FY2023, something <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to largely replicate in upcoming carriage agreements with other content providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Revenue and EBITDA for the FYE Dec. 31, 2023 totaled $54.6 billion and $21.9 billion, respectively, largely in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Charter had approximately $97.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $70.3 billion of senior secured debt. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated FYE Dec. 31, 2023 gross leverage was 4.6x, well within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s negative rating sensitivities, while secured leverage was 3.3x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operating Momentum: Charter focuses on a market share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance its service offerings' overall competitiveness, while effectively managing costs. As a result, revenues increased to $54.6 billion for the FYE ended Dec. 31, 2023 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 4.6% six-year CAGR, while margins improved by approximately 330 bps to 40.1%. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects near-term growth to continue to slow as Charter works to offset increasing competitive pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) became Charter's largest product segment in 2020 as consumers became increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities during the pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects broadband growth will be challenging over the next two years, but will continue to offset the expected continued industrywide basic video subscriber declines, while also benefiting margins and FCF, given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity. Wireless is expected to see continued growth and eventually offset related infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Performance: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects near-term broadband revenues to be compressed by 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) competition and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s low expectations for the renewal of the Affordable Connectivity Program's (<span class="companylink">ACP</span>) funding. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter's broadband revenues to be slightly down to flat over the next two years. Although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects broadband to generate low single digit growth in 2026 and beyond, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will closely monitor Charter's relative performance over the next 12-18 months to consider the potential for larger operational issues for Charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FWA has become the disruptor <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expected, pressuring broadband sub growth across the cable industry. After navigating this threat early, Charter's lost 61 thousand broadband subscribers in 4Q23 (off a base of more than 30 million) due primarily to FWA promotional activities. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes FWA will remain a competitive threat as broadband customers continue to lean into FWA's lower priced offerings. However, Charter's near-term planned investment in its hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) network will enhance broadband speeds through the provision of bundled home broadband, advanced Wi-Fi and mobile lines, which should enhance its competitive position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter has approximately five million broadband subscribers benefitting from the <span class="companylink">ACP</span>, a federal program designed to bridge the broadband internet access digital divide by providing subsidies to qualifying households. Program funding runs out in April 2024 and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes there is a low probability for renewal given the current political landscape. However, Charter noted most subscribers benefitting from <span class="companylink">ACP</span> were customers before its inception, as Charter had been providing broadband access to economically challenged customers since before the pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to work aggressively to retain as many subscribers as possible if funding is not renewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mobile Offering: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes Charter's mobile service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. To bolster network capabilities and connectivity, further reduce its dependency on its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc.</span>, and drive margin improvement, Charter continues to build out and deploy its Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash Generating Capacity and Uses: Charter converts more than 25% of revenues to FCF before capex, creating significant capacity for internal (capex) and external (shareholder returns) uses. Management recently updated its capex expectations through FY2027, including updated timing around increased spending on line extensions and network evolution that began in FY2023 and will continue into FY2026 but excluding potential spending associated with the Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. During that period, Charter's CFO less capex/debt percentage decreases to the low-single digits (3.2% at Dec. 31, 2023) before returning to its historical mid-single percentage levels by FY2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the capex ramp up positively. The line extensions provide fallow ground for new customer conversion with less robust competition. In addition, a significant portion of the buildout cost will be covered by RDOF funds. The upgrades to its <span class="companylink">HFC</span> network will cover 100% of its footprint with capex allocation centered on market and customer demographics along with the scale of competitive threats. Despite the aggregate amount of upgrade capex spent, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter's scale and market concentration to keep upgrade costs at approximately $100 per household passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter will continue to maximize shareholder returns by coupling FCF with debt capacity created by EBITDA growth to remain at the high end of its net leverage target of 4.0x-4.5x. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA growth to slow over the rating horizon, thereby constraining new debt capacity creation. Coupled with Charter's increased allocation to capex, this results in lower shareholder returns over the next three years before moving towards historical levels in FY2027. Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $170 million of its class A common stock and <span class="companylink">CCH</span> common units as of Dec. 31, 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings Linked: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating approach equalizes the IDRs across Charter's corporate structure, comprising Charter, CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE, in accordance with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD with 32.1 million total customer relationships and largest U.S. linear video content distributor with 14.1 million customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) is rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. Although DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC (BB+/Stable) lacks Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and FCF levels, it has lower closing leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T Corp.</span>'s 70% economic ownership after its spin-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings are held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining at the high end of its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--For 2024, total revenues are relatively flat as wireless and advertising growth offset broadband pressures and continued declines in the video and voice segments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Thereafter, total revenues grow in the low single digits. Wireless growth continues, albeit at a declining pace given the increased base. Broadband eventually returns to low single digit growth as the company benefits from ARPU growth and footprint expansion. Video and voice decline mid-single digits annually as price increases are unable to fully offset mid-single-digit subscriber declines;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA growth slows but margins improve slightly driven by wireless platform improvement;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex will be elevated over the next three years, in line with management expectations. This is driven by network upgrades with a focus on enhancing upstream capacity, an upgrade to DOCSIS 4.0 and efforts to bolster wireless network capabilities and connectivity along with footprint expansion focusing on edge and rural buildouts, with a portion of the latter offset by RDOF funding. Capital intensity is expected to increase to the low 20% range over that time before returning to the mid-teens by FY2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF troughs in the low $2 billion range in 2024 before growing to more than $7.0 billion by 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund near-term maturities, with additional issuance to fund shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--M&A activity is excluded, given the lack of transformational acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of its operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth and strengthening operating margins;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and that it will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF. The company's liquidity position at Dec. 31, 2023 included approximately $709 million of cash and approximately $3.2 billion of availability under its $5.5 billion revolver which matures in August 2027 (<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes Charter's January 2024 redemption of $2 billion of notes maturing during 2024 were funded with revolver drawings).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2026 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $0.4 billion is due in 2024, $5.2 billion in 2025, and $2.2 billion in 2026. Although maturities increase to $11 billion in 2027, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance a significant portion of the remainder over the next three years in line with historical actions. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $1.5 billion in 2037 to $6.5 billion in 2031. Required term loan amortization and maturities total $390 million in 2024, $700 million in 2025, $387 million in 2026 and $7.7 billion in 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-04 August 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BB+' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span> (CCO), <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (<span class="companylink">CCOH</span>), Time Warner Cable, LLC (TWC) and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (TWCE) and assigned a 'BB+' Long-Term IDR to <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed the 'BBB-'/'RR1' senior secured ratings for instruments at CCO, TWC, and TWCE and the 'BB+'/'RR4' senior unsecured ratings for instruments at <span class="companylink">CCOH</span>. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also assigned a 'BB+'/'RR4' rating to <span class="companylink">CCOH</span>'s proposed benchmark issuance. Charter is expected to use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (<span class="companylink">CCH</span>), a subsidiary of Charter, repayment of indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of June 30, 2022, Charter's stock buyback program had the authority to purchase an additional $673 million of its class A common stock and <span class="companylink">CCH</span> common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' rating to CCO's Term Loans A-5 and A-6, the net proceeds of which were used for repayment of existing indebtedness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has withdrawn the 'BBB-'/'RR1' ratings on Charter's Term Loan A-4 as they were repaid in full in May 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD behind Comcast Corp. Charter's 32.1 million customer relationships at June 30, 2022 provide significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Revenue and EBITDA in the LTM ended June 30, 2022 totalled $53.2 billion and $21.4 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, Charter had approximately $95.7 billion of debt outstanding, including $70.6 billion of senior secured debt. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates total Fitch-calculated gross leverage was 4.5x while secured leverage was 3.3x for LTM ended June 30, 2022, well within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s negative rating sensitivities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Continued Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and operating metrics while expanding margins. The company is focusing on a market share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance its service offerings' overall competitiveness. As a result, revenues increased to $53.2 billion for the LTM ended June 30, 2022 from $41.6 billion in 2017 while <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-calculated margins improved by 340 bps to 40.2%, as Charter's wireless business moves toward break-even and the cable business continues its positive operating momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenue surpassed video services revenue in 2020 and became the company's largest segment as consumers became increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities during the pandemic, including facilitating access to video streaming services and working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> continues to believe broadband growth will offset the expected continued industrywide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF, given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity. Wireless is expected to see continued growth and eventually offset related infrastructure spending, however systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects broadband additions will continue to slow over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint, coupled with the pressure of the significant pull forward of broadband additions as a result of the pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects ARPU growth to drive broadband revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits over the rating horizon. Charter plans to continue to expand its footprint, which has grown to 55 million homes and businesses passed at June 30, 2022 from 50.3 million at YE 2017. For 2022, Charter guided total capex of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion excluding capex associated with its mobile and rural construction initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter expects to spend $5 billion over the next six years on a rural construction initiative build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas ($589 million spent in 1H22). To help fund this, Charter will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). Although the aggregate footprint expansion provides growth potential, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Wireless Offering: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes Charter's wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To bolster network capabilities and connectivity and further reduce its dependency on the MVNO, Charter has been building out and deploying the Citizen Broadband Radio Service spectrum it purchased in 2020. Each of these actions are expected to drive margin improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for Internet of Things applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and to remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns, internal investment and accretive acquisitions. Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $673 million of its class A common stock and <span class="companylink">CCH</span> common units as of June 30, 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating approach equalizes the IDRs across Charter's corporate structure, comprising Charter, CCO, <span class="companylink">CCOH</span>, TWC and TWCE, in accordance with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space, given its size and geographic diversity. With 32.1 million customer relationships, Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD after <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) is rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. Although DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC (BB+/Stable) lacks Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and FCF levels, it has lower closing leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T Corp</span>.'s 70% economic ownership after its spin-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings are likely to be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total revenues increase by mid-single digits in 2022, soften to low-single digit growth in 2023 due to economic stressors, then return to mid-single digit growth thereafter. In 2022 and 2023, advertising plays a significant role due to the 2022 mid-term election cycle and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for an ad recession in 2023. Broadband growth slows to low single digits in 2023 due to the weak economic conditions and then returns to mid-single digits as the company benefits from ARPU increases and its footprint expansion. Video is expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single-digit subscriber declines. Mobile growth slows over the rating horizon to 20% by 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins improve as cable margins settle in the low 40% range and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter is a significant tax payer over the rating horizon as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continuous network upgrades with a focus on enhancing upstream capacity, an upgrade to DOCSIS 4.0 and efforts to bolster wireless network capabilities and connectivity. Footprint expansion will focus on edge and rural buildouts, although a portion of the latter will be offset by federal funding including the RDOF. Capital intensity is expected to remain in the mid-teens over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF ranges from $7.2 billion to $8.3 billion annually;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund near term maturities with additional issuance for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Leverage remains at 4.5x over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--M&A activity is excluded, given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and that it will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF. The company's liquidity position at June 30, 2022 comprised approximately $483 million of cash, supported by $4.4 billion of availability under its $5.5 billion revolver which matures in August 2027, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2024 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $195 million is due in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023, and $2.4 billion in 2024. Although maturities increase to $7.2 billion in 2025, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notes that amount has been reduced by $2.6 billion since Dec. 31, 2021, and expects the company to refinance a significant portion of the remainder over the next three years in line with historical actions. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $1.1 billion in 2026 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $976 million remaining through 2024, with $2.7 billion and $8.3 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and <span class="companylink">CCOH</span> is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> and <span class="companylink">CCOH</span>. All of <span class="companylink">CCOH</span>'s existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-10 March 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' ratings to <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span>'s (CCO) benchmark issuance of three senior secured note tranches. CCO is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCO's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and the repayment of indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of Dec. 31, 2021, <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.9 billion of its class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD behind Comcast Corp. Charter's 32.1 million customer relationships at Dec. 31, 2021 provide significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Revenue and EBITDA in the LTM ended Dec. 31, 2021 totaled $51.7 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively. As of Dec. 31, 2021, Charter had approximately $91.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $66.3 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for a January 2022 debt issuance and associated debt repayment. <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> estimates total Fitch-calculated pro forma gross leverage was 4.4x while secured leverage was 3.2x for LTM ended Dec. 31, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and subscriber metrics while expanding margins. The company is focusing on a market share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance its service offerings' overall competitiveness. As a result, revenues increased to $51.7 billion for the LTM ended Dec. 31, 2021 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 5.5% CAGR while margins improved by 310 bps to 39.9%, as Charter's wireless business moves closer to break even, and the cable business continues its positive operating momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded the capabilities of its mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To further bolster network capabilities and improve its cost structure, the company purchased 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service priority access licenses in 2020. Although the benefits of wireless are likely to eventually offset related infrastructure spending, systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenue surpassed video services revenue in 2020 and became the company's largest product segment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes broadband revenues will grow in the mid- to high-single digits over the rating horizon, as consumers became increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities during the pandemic, including facilitating access to video streaming services and working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These capabilities powered the cable sector's general outperformance relative to most other sectors. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes broadband growth will offset the expected continued industrywide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF, given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects broadband's growth will slow over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notes Charter plans to continue to expand its footprint, which has grown to 54.5 million homes and businesses passed at Dec, 31, 2021 from 50.3 million at YE 2017. In addition, <span class="companylink">Charter</span> will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas. Although these actions provide growth potential, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for Internet of Things applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and to remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns, internal investment and accretive acquisitions. <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.9 billion of its class A common stock and CCH common units as of Dec. 31, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> links the IDRs of CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE in accordance with its criteria due to the presence of strong legal, operational and strategic ties among the entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Charter</span> is well positioned in the MVPD space, given its size and geographic diversity. With 32.1 million customer relationships, <span class="companylink">Charter</span> is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD after <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) is rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. Although DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC (BB+/Stable) lacks Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and FCF levels, it has lower closing leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T Corp</span>.'s 70% economic ownership after its spin-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s ratings are likely to be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total revenue increases by mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon. Internet growth is expected to slow to mid-single digits as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its footprint, with video expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single-digit subscriber declines. Mobile growth slows to 20% over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA margins improve over the rating horizon as cable margins settle in the low 40% range and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash tax payments begin to increase in 2022 as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Charter</span> is expected to continuously upgrade its network with a focus on enhancing upstream capacity and an upgrade to DOCSIS 4.0. Capital intensity is expected to settle in around the mid-teens over the rating horizon, following the conversion of its primary cable infrastructure to 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 offering 1Gbps of service.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of its operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth and strengthening operating margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> regards <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and that it will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF. The company's liquidity position at Dec. 31, 2021 comprised approximately $601 million of cash, supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which will mature in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s maturities through 2024 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $3.3 billion is due in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023, and $2.3 billion in 2024. Although maturities increase to $9.8 billion in 2025, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance a significant portion over the next three years in line with historical actions. Over the next 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $750 million in 2026 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $978 million remaining through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Charter</span> will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not view <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, <span class="companylink">Charter</span>'s unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-13 January 2022: itch Ratings has assigned 'BB+'/'RR4' ratings to <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>'s (CCOH) benchmark issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2032. CCOH is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCOH's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and/or the repayment of indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of Sept. 30, 2021, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.5 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. Charter's 31.9 million customer relationships at Sept. 30, 2021 provide significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Revenue and EBITDA in the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2021 totaled $51.1 billion and $20.2 billion, respectively. As of Sept. 30, 2021, Charter had approximately $90.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $66.5 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for an October 2021 debt issuance and associated debt repayment. <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> estimates total Fitch-calculated pro forma gross leverage was 4.5x while secured leverage was 3.3x for LTM ended Sept. 30, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and subscriber metrics while expanding and margins. The company is focusing on a market share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance its service offerings' overall competitiveness. As a result, revenues increased to $51.1 billion for the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2021 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 5.6% CAGR. Margins improved by 290bps over the same period to 39.7%, as Charter's wireless business moved closer to break-even, and the cable business continues its positive operating momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Charter's wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded the capabilities of its mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To further bolster network capabilities and improve its cost structure, the company purchased 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service priority access licenses in 2020. Although the benefits of wireless are likely to eventually offset related infrastructure spending, systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenue surpassed video services revenue in 2020 and became the company's largest product segment. Fitch believes broadband revenues will grow in the low teens in 2021 as consumers became increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities, including facilitating access to video streaming services and working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These capabilities powered the cable sector's general outperformance relative to most other sectors. Fitch believes broadband growth will offset the expected continued industrywide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF, given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: Fitch expects broadband's growth will slow to mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint. Fitch notes Charter plans to continue to expand its footprint, which has grown to 54.2 million homes and businesses passed at Sept. 30, 2021 from 50.3 million at YE 2017. In addition, Charter will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas. Although these actions provide growth potential, Fitch is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. Fitch expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. Fitch expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for Internet of Things applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and to remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns, internal investment and accretive acquisitions. Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.5 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units as of Sept. 30, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: Fitch links the IDRs of CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE in accordance with its criteria due to the presence of strong legal, operational and strategic ties among the entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space, given its size and geographic diversity. With 31.9 million customer relationships, Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable MVPD after <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) is rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. Although DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings LLC (BB+/Stable) lacks Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and FCF levels, it will have lower closing leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T Corp</span>.'s 70% economic ownership after its spin-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings are likely to be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer Include</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total revenue increases by mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon. Internet growth is expected to slow to mid-single digits as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its footprint, with video expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single-digit subscriber declines. Mobile growth slows to 20% over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA margins improve over the rating horizon as cable margins settle in the low 40% range and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash tax payments begin to increase in 2022 as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter is expected to continuously upgrade its network. However, core cable capital intensity begins to decline as major upgrades in the primary cable infrastructure, which is now 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1Gbps of service, have been largely completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF grows to more than $9.0 billion by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter remains near the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x-4.5x;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and that it will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF. The company's liquidity position at Sept. 30, 2021 comprised approximately $466 million of cash, supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which will mature in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2024 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $69 million is due in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023 and $2.3 billion in 2024. Over the next 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $750 million in 2026 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $1.1 billion remaining through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-27 September 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB-'/'RR1' ratings to <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span>'s (CCO) benchmark issuance of three senior secured note tranches. CCO is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCO's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and/or the repayment of indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of June 30, 2021, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the second largest U.S. cable multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Charter's 31.8 million customer relationships at June 30, 2021 provide the company with significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: LTM ended June 30, 2021 revenue and EBITDA totalled $50.0 billion and $19.6 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, Charter had approximately $86.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $62.6 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for the July 2021 redemption of $1 billion of <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, LLC</span>'s (TWC) 4.0% senior secured notes due 2021. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated pro forma gross leverage was 4.4x while secured leverage was 3.2x for LTM June 30, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and subscriber metrics while growing revenue and margins. The company is focusing on a market-share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance the overall competitiveness of its service offerings. As a result, revenues increased to $50.0 billion for the LTM ended June 30, 2021 from 2020 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 5.4% 3.5-year CAGR. Over the same period, margins improved by 240 bps to 39.2% as Charter's wireless business moved closer to breakeven, and the cable business continues its positive operating momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Charter's wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded the capabilities of their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To further bolster network capabilities and improve their cost structure, the company purchased 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) priority access licenses in 2020. While the benefits of wireless should eventually offset related infrastructure spending, systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenues surpassed video services revenues during fiscal 2020 and became the company's largest product segment. Fitch believes broadband revenues will grow in the high single digits in 2021 as consumers have become increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities, including facilitating access to burgeoning video streaming services and working from home. These capabilities powered the cable sector's general outperformance relative to most other sectors. Fitch believes broadband's growth will offset the expected continued industrywide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: Fitch expects broadband's growth will slow to mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint. Charter plans to continue expanding its total footprint, which it has grown to 53.9 million homes passed at June 30, 2021 from 50.3 million at Dec. 31, 2017. In addition, the company will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas. While these actions provide new growth potential, Fitch is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. Fitch expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. Fitch expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for Internet of Things applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. As of June 30, 2021, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: Fitch links the IDRs of CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE in accordance with its criteria due to the presence of strong legal, operational and strategic ties between the entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 31.8 million customer relationships, Charter is the second largest U.S. cable MVPD after <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) is rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. Although <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> (BB+/Stable) lacks Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and higher FCF, it will have lower closing leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>'s 70% economic ownership after the spin-off is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling, or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues: Total revenues increase low to mid-single digits over the rating horizon. Internet growth is expected to slow from high single digits to mid-single digits as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its footprint. Video is expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single-digit subscriber declines. Fitch expects mobile growth to slow to 20% over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA Margins: Total margins improve by 100 bps over the rating horizon as cable margins settle in in the low 40% and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter's cash tax payments increase in 2022 as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity begins to decline over time as primary cable, which is now 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service, and wireless infrastructure upgrades have been completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF grows to $8.1 billion by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x to 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of June 30, 2021 comprised approximately $700 million of cash, pro forma for the July 2021 TWC notes redemption, and was supported by $4.7 billion of availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which will mature in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2024 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $139 million is due in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023, and $2.3 billion in 2024. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $750 million in 2026 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $1.1 billion remaining through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-02 August 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BB+'/'RR4' ratings to <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>'s (CCOH) benchmark issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2034. CCOH is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCOH's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and/or the repayment of indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of June 30, 2021, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the second largest U.S. multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Charter's 31.8 million customer relationships at June 30, 2021 provide the company with significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: LTM ended June 30, 2021 revenue and EBITDA totalled $50.0 billion and $19.6 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, Charter had approximately $86.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $62.6 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for the July 2021 redemption of $1 billion of <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, LLC</span>'s (TWC) 4.0% senior secured notes due 2021. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated pro forma gross leverage was 4.4x while secured leverage was 3.2x for LTM June 30, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and subscriber metrics while growing revenue and margins. The company is focusing on a market-share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance the overall competitiveness of its service offerings. As a result, revenues increased to $50.0 billion for the LTM ended June 30, 2021 from 2020 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 5.4% 3.5-year CAGR. Over the same period, margins improved by 240 bps to 39.2% as Charter's wireless business moved closer to breakeven and the cable business continues its positive operating momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Charter's wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded the capabilities of their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To further bolster network capabilities and improve their cost structure, the company purchased 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) priority access licenses in 2020. While the benefits of wireless should eventually offset related infrastructure spending, systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenues surpassed video services revenues during fiscal 2020 and became the company's largest product segment. Fitch believes broadband revenues will grow in the high single digits in 2021 as consumers have become increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities, including facilitating access to burgeoning video streaming services and working from home. These capabilities powered the cable sector's general outperformance relative to most other sectors. Fitch believes broadband's growth will offset the expected continued industrywide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: Fitch expects broadband's growth will slow to mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint. Fitch notes Charter plans to continue expanding its total footprint, which it has grown to 53.9 million homes passed at June 30, 2021 from 50.3 million at Dec. 31, 2017. In addition, the company will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas. While these actions provide new growth potential, Fitch is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. Fitch expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. Fitch expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for Internet of Things applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. As of June 30, 2021, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: Fitch links the IDRs of CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE in accordance with its criteria due to the presence of strong legal, operational and strategic ties between the entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 31.8 million customer relationships, Charter is the third largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span> and <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>, which is being spun off by <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (BBB+/Stable) and will include <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>'s <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span>, U-verse, AT&T TV and legacy AT&T TV Now and Watch TV assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) is rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification. Although <span class="companylink">DIRECTV</span> (BB+/Stable) lacks Charter's segment diversification, scale, growth prospects and higher FCF, it will have lower closing leverage and greater geographic diversification. It also received a one-notch uplift from <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>'s 70% economic ownership after the spin-off is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling, or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues: Total revenues increase low to mid-single digits over the rating horizon. Internet growth is expected to slow from high single digits to mid-single digits as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its footprint. Video is expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single-digit subscriber declines. Mobile growth is expected to slow to 20% over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA Margins: Total margins improve by 100 bps over the rating horizon as cable margins settle in in the low 40% and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter's cash tax payments increase in 2022 as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity begins to decline over time as primary cable, which is now 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service, and wireless infrastructure upgrades have been completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF grows to $8.1 billion by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x to 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of June 30, 2021 comprised approximately $700 million of cash, pro forma for the July 2021 TWC notes redemption, and was supported by $4.7 billion of availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which will mature in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2024 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $139 million is due in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023, and $2.3 billion in 2024. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $2.0 billion in 2035 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $1.1 billion remaining through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. For more information on Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores, visit www.fitchratings.com/esg[http://www.fitchratings.com/esg].</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-18 May 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span>'s (CCO) proposed benchmark-sized issuance of senior secured notes with varying maturities. CCO is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCO's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+'/ Stable. Fitch notes <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (CCOH) will also be issuing an add-on to its existing 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2033.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter had approximately $85.3 billion of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2021, including $60.8 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for CCOH's April 2021 issuance of $1.0 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and/or the repayment of indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of Dec. 31, 2020, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.5 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the second largest U.S. multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Charter's 31.4 million customer relationships at March 31, 2021 provide the company with significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: LTM ended March 31, 2021 revenue and EBITDA totalled $48.9 billion and $19.1 billion, respectively. Pro forma for recent debt issuance and repayments, as of March 31, 2021, Charter had approximately $85.3 billion of debt outstanding, including $60.8 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for CCOH's April 2021 issuance of $1.0 billion. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated pro forma gross leverage was 4.6x while secured leverage was 3.3x for LTM March 31, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and subscriber metrics while growing revenue and margins. The company is focusing on a market-share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance the overall competitiveness of its service offerings. As a result, total revenues increased to $48.1 billion in 2020 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 5% three-year CAGR. Although margins improved by 170 bps to 38.5% from 36.8% over the same period, Fitch notes wireless rollout spending provided a significant margin drag and that cable margins improved by almost 370 bps to 40.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Charter's wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded the capabilities of their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To further bolster network capabilities and improve their cost structure, the company purchased 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) priority access licenses in 2020. While the benefits of wireless should eventually offset related infrastructure spending, systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenues surpassed video services revenues during fiscal 2020 and became the company's largest product segment. Fitch believes broadband will grow in the high single digits in 2021, even assuming remaining shelter-in-place prohibitions are fully lifted over the next few months, as consumers have become increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities, including facilitating access to burgeoning video streaming services and working from home. These capabilities powered the cable sector's general outperformance relative to most other sectors. Fitch believes broadband's growth will offset the expected continued industrywide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: Fitch expects broadband's growth will slow to mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint. Fitch notes Charter plans to continue expanding its total footprint, which it has grown to 53.6 million homes passed at March 31, 2021 from 50.3 million at Dec. 31, 2017. In addition, the company will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas. While these actions provide new growth potential, Fitch is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. Fitch expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. Fitch expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for Internet of Things applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. As of March 31, 2021, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.2 billion of its class A common stock and/or CCH's common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: Fitch links the IDRs of CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE in accordance with its criteria due to the presence of strong legal, operational and strategic ties between the entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 31.1 million customer relationships, Charter is the third largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> and U-verse offerings and <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>. Both <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling, or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues: Total revenues increase low to mid-single digits over the rating horizon. Internet growth is expected to slow from high single digits to mid-single digits as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its footprint. Video is expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single-digit subscriber declines. Mobile growth is expected to slow to 20% over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA Margins: Total margins improve by 100 bps over the rating horizon as cable margins settle in in the low 40% and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter's cash tax payments increase in 2022 as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity begins to decline over time as primary cable, 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service and wireless infrastructure upgrades have been completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF grows to $8.1 billion by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x to 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of March 31, 2021 comprised approximately $772 million of cash and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver; $249 million of which will mature in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2024 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $1.2 billion is due in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023 and $2.3 billion in 2024. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $2.0 billion in 2033 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $1.2 billion remaining through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-19 April 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BB+'/'RR4' ratings to <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>'s (CCOH) benchmark issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2033. CCOH is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCOH's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of class A common stock of Charter or common units of subsidiary <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), to repay certain indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the third largest U.S. multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary) and the second largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Charter's 31.1 million customer relationships at Dec. 31, 2020 provide the company with significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: LTM ended Dec. 31, 2020 revenue and EBITDA totalled $48.1 billion and $18.5 billion, respectively. Pro forma for recent debt issuance and repayments, as of Dec. 31, 2020, Charter had approximately $84.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $60.9 billion of senior secured debt. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated pro forma gross leverage was 4.6x while secured leverage was 3.3x for LTM Dec. 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and subscriber metrics while growing revenue and margins. The company is focusing on a market-share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance the overall competitiveness of its service offerings. As a result, total revenues increased to $48.1 billion in 2020 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 5% three-year CAGR. Although margins improved by 170 bps to 38.5% from 36.8% over the same period, Fitch notes wireless rollout spending provided a significant margin drag and that cable margins improved by almost 370 bps to 40.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Charter's wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded the capabilities of their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To further bolster network capabilities and improve their cost structure, the company purchased 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) priority access licenses in 2020. While the benefits of wireless should eventually offset related infrastructure spending, systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenues surpassed video services revenues during fiscal 2020 and became the company's largest product segment. Fitch believes broadband will grow in the high single digits in 2021, even assuming remaining shelter-in-place prohibitions are fully lifted over the next few months, as consumers have become increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities, including facilitating access to burgeoning video streaming services and working from home. These capabilities powered the cable sector's general outperformance relative to most other sectors. Fitch believes broadband's growth will offset the expected continued industrywide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: Fitch expects broadband's growth will slow to mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint. Fitch notes Charter plans to continue expanding its total footprint, which it has grown to 53.3 million homes passed at Dec. 31, 2020 from 50.3 million at Dec. 31, 2017, a 1.9% three-year CAGR. In addition, the company will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) to build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas. While these actions provide new growth potential, Fitch is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. Fitch expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. Fitch expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for internet of things (IoT) applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns (as of Dec. 31, 2020, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.5 billion of its class A common stock and/or CCH's common units) along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: Fitch links the IDRs of CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE in accordance with its criteria due to the presence of strong legal, operational and strategic ties between the entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 31.1 million customer relationships, Charter is the third largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> and U-verse offerings and <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>. Both <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling, or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues: Total revenues increase low to mid-single digits over the rating horizon. Internet growth is expected to slow from high single digits to mid-single digits as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its footprint. Video is expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single digit subscriber declines. Mobile growth is expected to slow to 20% over the rating horizon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA Margins: Total margins improve by 100 bps over the rating horizon as cable margins settle in in the low 40% and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter's cash tax payments increase in 2022 as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity begins to decline over time as primary cable, 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service and wireless infrastructure upgrades have been completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF grows to $8.1 billion by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x to 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory and will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of Dec. 31, 2020 comprised approximately $1 billion of cash and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver; $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2023 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$1.3 billion is due in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022 and $1.9 billion in 2023. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $1.5 billion in 2029 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $1.3 billion through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-14 April 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BB+' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) assigned to <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span> (CCO), <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (CCOH), <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, LLC</span> (TWC) and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (TWCE). Fitch has also affirmed the 'BBB-'/'RR1' senior secured ratings for instruments at CCO, TWC, and TWCE and the 'BB+'/'RR4' senior unsecured ratings for instruments at CCOH. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCOH, CCO, TWC, and TWCE are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. TWC and TWCE have legacy senior secured debt outstanding but are not expected to issue new debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the third-largest U.S. multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary) and the second largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Charter's 31.1 million customer relationships at Dec. 31, 2020 provide the company with significant scale benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: LTM ended Dec. 31, 2020 revenue and EBITDA totalled $48.1 billion and $18.5 billion, respectively. Pro forma for recent debt issuance and repayments, as of Dec. 31, 2020, Charter had approximately $84.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $60.9 billion of senior secured debt. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated pro forma gross leverage was 4.6x, while secured leverage was 3.3x for LTM Dec. 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are strengthening its competitive position and subscriber metrics while growing revenue and margins. The company is focusing on a market-share-driven strategy, leveraging its all-digital infrastructure to enhance the overall competitiveness of its service offerings. As a result, total revenues increased to $48.1 billion in 2020 from $41.6 billion in 2017, a 5% three-year CAGR. Although margins improved by 170 bp to 38.5% from 36.8% over the same period, Fitch notes wireless rollout spending provided a significant margin drag, and that cable margins improved by almost 370 bp to 40.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Charter's wireless service expansion offers further operating leverage improvement through scaling benefits. In November 2020, Charter extended and expanded the capabilities of their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. To further bolster network capabilities and improve their cost structure, the company purchased 210 Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) priority access licenses in 2020. While the benefits of wireless should eventually offset related infrastructure spending, systemwide rollout costs are expected to continue to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Product Mix Shift: Internet services (broadband) revenues surpassed video services revenues during fiscal 2020 and became the company's largest product segment. Fitch believes broadband will grow in the high single digits in 2021, even assuming remaining shelter-in-place prohibitions are fully lifted over the next few months, as consumers have become increasingly reliant on broadband's capabilities, including facilitating access to burgeoning video streaming services and working from home. These capabilities powered the cable sector's general outperformance relative to most other sectors. Fitch believes broadband's growth will offset the expected continued industry-wide decline in basic video subscribers while also benefiting margins and FCF given broadband's higher margins and lower capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Broadband Growth: Fitch expects broadband's growth will slow to mid-single digits annually over the rating horizon as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its existing footprint. Fitch notes Charter plans to continue expanding its total footprint, which it has grown to 53.3 million homes passed at Dec. 31, 2020 from 50.3 million at Dec. 31, 2017, a 1.9% three-year CAGR. In addition, the company will receive an aggregate $1.2 billion over 10 years from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) to build out broadband capabilities in unserved areas. While these actions provide new growth potential, Fitch is unsure penetration levels will replicate historical levels, especially in currently unserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential 5G Disruption: 5G wireless technology deployment will likely become a long-term disrupter, as wireline and wireless connectivity convergence will threaten legacy competitive positions, including Charter's broadband business. Fitch expects 5G will bring new business models, new use cases and the potential for fixed wireless to capture some broadband share over the medium term. Fitch expects 5G to fully interoperate with 4G and become an important enabler for internet of things (IoT) applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns (as of Dec. 31, 2020, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.5 billion of its class A common stock and/or CCH's common units) along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings are Linked: Fitch links the IDRs of CCO, CCOH, TWC and TWCE in accordance with its criteria due to the presence of strong legal, operational and strategic ties between the entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 31.1 million customer relationships, Charter is the third-largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> and U-verse offerings, and <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>. Both <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth, while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling, or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues: Total revenues increase low to mid-single digits over the rating horizon. Internet growth is expected to slow from high single digits to mid-single digits as Charter approaches penetration saturation in its footprint. Video is expected to decline 1% annually as price increases are unable to fully offset annual mid-single digit subscriber declines. Mobile growth is expected to slow to 20% over the rating horizon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA Margins: Total margins improve by 100 bp over the rating horizon as cable margins settle in in the low 40% and wireless margins become positive;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter's cash tax payments increase in 2022 as NOLs roll off;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity begins to decline over time as primary cable, 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service, and wireless infrastructure upgrades have been completed;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF grows to $8.1 billion by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x to 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory, and will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of Dec. 31, 2020 comprised approximately $1 billion of cash and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver; $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2023 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $1.3 billion is due in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022 and $1.9 billion in 2023. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $1.5 billion in 2029 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $1.3 billion through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-18 February 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span>'s (CCO) proposed benchmark-sized issuance of senior secured notes with varying maturities. CCO is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCO's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+'/Outlook Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter had approximately $82.1 billion of debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2020, including $57.9 billion of senior secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and/or the repayment of indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of Dec. 31, 2020, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.5 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the third-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary, and the second-largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Credit Profile: Charter had 31.1 million customer relationships as of Dec. 31, 2020, positioning it as one of the largest MVPDs in the U.S. and providing significant scale benefits. The company reported revenue and EBITDA of approximately $48.1 billion and $18.5 billion, respectively, for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2020, resulting in gross leverage of 4.4x and secured leverage of 3.1x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Operating Metrics: Charter's operating strategies positively affect its operating profile while strengthening its competitive position. Charter's focus on enhancing its video service's competitiveness and leveraging its all-digital infrastructure improves subscriber metrics, revenue, average revenue per user and operating margins. Fitch believes Charter's mobile service expansion under its mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. offers potential bundling benefits and should eventually offset near-term infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integration Execution: Charter's ability to manage the integration of simultaneous transactions while limiting disruptions in existing systems is reflected in the company's improved cable operating performance. Fitch believes Charter realized its expected run-rate transaction integration synergies, but systemwide wireless rollout costs are expected to negatively affect near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic's Impact: The cable sector has proven more resilient to downturns than other sectors, given the integral nature of broadband services and the industry's predictable recurring payment stream. Fitch believes shelter-in-place efforts will continue to drive broadband growth in the near term, although at a declining rate, which should more than offset continued declines in video subscribers and the advertising recession, excluding political ads, which Fitch expects to last into 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Long-term financial damage to the sector remains highly uncertain, depending on the pandemic's continued severity and duration. However, the decline in business services was temporary and has seen a slow recovery ahead of Fitch's expectations. Although the pandemic could have an outsized negative effect on smaller businesses, as owners may be unwilling or unable to reopen the longer the pandemic continues, Fitch believes this segment represents less than 10% of Charter's FYE Dec. 31, 2020 total revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity: Charter maintains a target net leverage of 4.0x-4.5x, and secured leverage up to 3.5x. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under created debt capacity are expected to be used primarily for shareholder returns, along with internal investments and accretive acquisitions. Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.5 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH's common units as of Dec. 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not expect Charter to maintain significant cash balances, resulting in Fitch-calculated total gross leverage roughly equating total net leverage over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well-positioned in the MVPD space, given its size and geographic diversity. Its 31.1 million customer relationships make Charter the third-largest U.S. MVPD, following <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>, through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary. Both <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings are likely to remain at the current level as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth, while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns, along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent-subsidiary relationship factors affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within its Rating Case for the Issuer Include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Total revenues increase by mid-single digits as Fitch expects the coronavirus pandemic to have offsetting effects on Charter's business segments. The absence of political ads in 2021 results in a high-single-digit overall advertising revenue decline. Video revenues are expected to realize continued low-single-digit growth over the rating horizon, as rate increases more than offset ongoing underlying subscriber losses. However, these issues are more than offset by mid- to high-single-digit internet revenue growth due to increased internet usage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Total EBITDA margins improve over the rating horizon, as continued cable margin improvement more than offsets negative wireless margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital intensity begins to decline as primary cable — 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service — and wireless infrastructure upgrades are completed and revenues continue to grow. However, annual capex spending declines by less than 10% over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF improves to $9.4 billion by 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter remains at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x-4.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers regarding service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage above 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory, and will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of Dec. 31, 2020 comprised approximately $1 billion of cash and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2023 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $1.3 billion is due in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022 and $1.9 billion in 2023. Over the following 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $1.5 billion in 2029 to $5.8 billion in 2030. Required term loan amortization totals $1.3 billion through 2024, with $5.3 billion and $3.5 billion due at maturity in 2025 and 2027, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-19 November 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span>'s (CCO) proposed benchmark-sized issuance of senior secured notes with varying maturities. CCO is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCO's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+'/Outlook Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter had approximately $79.8 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2020, including $55.6 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for an October 2020 debt issuance, plus completed and expected debt repurchases, redemptions or repayments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and/or the repayment certain indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. As of Sept. 30, 2020, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional $1.6 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH common units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the third-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary, and the second-largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Fitch continues to view Charter's May 2016 merger with TWC and the acquisition of <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> as a positive, as they strengthened Charter's overall credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Credit Profile: Charter had 30.9 million customer relationships as of Sept. 30, 2020, positioning it as one of the largest MVPDs in the U.S. and providing significant scale benefits. Revenue and EBITDA totaled approximately $47.2 billion and $18.0 billion, respectively, at the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2020. Fitch-calculated gross leverage was 4.4x in the period, and secured leverage was 3.1x, pro forma for a recent debt issuance, plus completed and expected debt repurchases, redemptions or repayments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Operating Metrics: Charter's operating strategies positively affect its operating profile while strengthening its competitive position. Charter's focus on enhancing its video service's competitiveness and leveraging its all-digital infrastructure improves subscriber metrics, revenue, average revenue per user and operating margins. Fitch believes Charter's mobile service expansion under its mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. offers potential bundling benefits and should eventually offset near-term infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integration Execution: Charter's ability to manage the integration of simultaneous transactions while limiting disruptions in existing systems is reflected in the company's improved cable operating performance. Fitch believes Charter realized its expected run-rate transaction integration synergies, but systemwide wireless rollout costs are expected to negatively affect near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic's Impact: The cable sector has proven more resilient to downturns than other sectors, given the integral nature of broadband services and the industry's predictable recurring payment stream. Fitch believes shelter-in-place efforts will continue to drive broadband growth in the near term, which should more than offset continued declines in video subscribers, near-term declines in business services and an expected advertising recession, excluding political ads, which Fitch expects to last into 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Long-term financial damage to the sector and the recovery trajectory remain highly uncertain, depending on the severity and duration of the pandemic. Fitch expects the decline in business services will be temporary and will recover with the economy. However, the pandemic could have an outsized negative effect on small and medium businesses, as owners may be unwilling or unable to reopen. Fitch believes this segment represents less than 10% of Charter's LTM ended Sept. 30, 2020 total revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity: Charter maintains a target net leverage of 4.0x-4.5x, and secured leverage up to 3.5x. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under created debt capacity are expected to be used primarily for shareholder returns, along with internal investments and accretive acquisitions. Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.6 billion of its Class A common stock and CCH's common units as of Sept. 30, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not expect Charter to maintain significant cash balances, resulting in Fitch-calculated total gross leverage roughly equating total net leverage over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well-positioned in the MVPD space, given its size and geographic diversity. Its 30.9 million customer relationships make Charter the third-largest U.S. MVPD, following <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>, through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary. Both <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings are likely to remain at the current level as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth, while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns, along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent-subsidiary relationship factors affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within its Rating Case for the Issuer Include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Total revenues increase by mid-single digits as Fitch expects the coronavirus pandemic to have offsetting effects on Charter's business segments. Fitch expects significant declines in SMB revenues through 2021, as shelter-in-place requirements increase the potential for companies to go out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Advertising is expected to be soft over the same period, while political spending offsets mid- to high-single-digit declines in underlying advertising spend in 2020. The absence of political ads in 2021 results in a high-single-digit overall decline. However, these issues are more than offset by internet revenue growth, expected in the mid-teens in 2020 due to increased internet usage, and returning to historical mid-single-digit increases thereafter. In addition, video revenues are expected to realize continued low-single-digit growth over the rating horizon, despite ongoing underlying subscriber losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Total EBITDA margins improve by almost 100bps over the rating horizon, as continued cable margin improvement more than offsets negative wireless margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital intensity begins to decline as primary cable — 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service — and wireless infrastructure upgrades are completed and revenues continue to grow. However, annual capex spending declines by less than 10% over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF improves to $9.4 billion from $4.4 billion by 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter remains at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x-4.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers regarding service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage above 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory. Charter's financial flexibility will improve in line with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of Sept. 30, 2020 comprised approximately $1.2 billion of cash and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, as well as anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturities through 2022 are manageable. Including required term loan amortization, $69 million remained due in 2020, $2.0 billion in 2021 and $3.3 billion in 2022. Over the next 10 years, annual bond maturities range from $1.5 billion in 2023 to $5.8 billion in 2030, while required term loan amortization and maturities total $10.2 billion through 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter will need to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to service annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, but its liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage is expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon. Fitch does not view Charter's secured leverage and strong underlying asset value as structural subordination that could impair recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Therefore, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from its IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-06 July 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BB+'/'RR4' ratings to <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>'s (CCOH) benchmark issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2031. CCOH is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCOH's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Charter had approximately $79.1 billion of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2020, including $54.6 billion of senior secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of certain CCOH indebtedness, potential buybacks of class A common stock of Charter or common units of subsidiary <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), and to pay related fees and expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the third-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary, and the second-largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Fitch continues to view Charter's May 2016 merger with <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, LLC</span> (TWC) and acquisition of <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> positively and believes they strengthen Charter's overall credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Charter's 29.7 million customer relationships as of March 31, 2020 position it as one of the largest MVPDs in the U.S., providing the company with significant scale benefits. LTM revenue and EBITDA totaled approximately $46.3 billion and $17.2 billion, respectively. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated gross leverage was 4.6x, while secured leverage was 3.2x for LTM March 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are positively affecting its operating profile, resulting in a strengthened competitive position. The market share-driven strategy focusing on enhancing the overall competitiveness of its video service and leveraging its expanding all-digital infrastructure is improving subscriber metrics, growing revenue and ARPU, and stabilizing operating margins. Fitch also believes the expansion of Charter's mobile service offerings under a mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. should offer potential future bundling benefits, which should eventually offset the near-term infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integration Execution: Charter's ability to manage the simultaneous integration of the transactions while limiting disruptions in existing systems is captured in the company's improved cable operating performance. Although Fitch believes Charter has realized its expected run-rate transaction integration synergies, system-wide wireless rollout costs are expected to be a drag on near-term total margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Implications of the Coronavirus Pandemic: Fitch believes the cable sector, including Charter, will be more resilient to a downturn than other sectors given the integral nature of video and broadband services, especially in the current environment, and the industry's predictable recurring payment stream. As such, over the near term Fitch assumes shelter in place requirements will have a positive effect on video and broadband growth, which should more than offset significant declines in the SMB segment and an advertising recession, excluding political, both lasting into 2021. However, although Fitch expects an increase in bad debt expense and ongoing mid-single digit subscriber declines after a slight lull in 2020, the long-term potential for financial damage to the sector and the trajectory of any recovery remain highly uncertain, depending on the severity and duration of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. As of March 31, 2020, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $286 million of its class A common stock and/or CCH's common units. Fitch does not expect Charter to maintain significant cash balances, resulting in Fitch-calculated total gross leverage roughly equating to total net leverage over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 29.7 million customer relationships, Charter is the third-largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> and U-verse offerings, and <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>. Both <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth, while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within its Rating Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues: Total revenues increase mid-single digits as Fitch expects the coronavirus pandemic to have offsetting effects on Charter's business segments. Near term, Fitch is expecting significant declines in SMB revenues through 2021, as shelter in place requirements increase the potential for companies to go out of business. Advertising is expected to be soft over the same period, while political spending offsets mid- to high single digit declines in underlying ad spend in 2020, the absence of political ads in 2021 results in a high single digit overall decline. However, these issues are more than offset by Internet revenue growth, expected in the mid-teens in 2020 due to increased Internet usage and returning to historical mid-single digit increases thereafter. In addition, video revenues are expected to realize continued low single digit growth over the rating horizon, despite ongoing underlying subscriber losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA Margins: Total margins improve by almost 100bps over the rating horizon as continued cable margin improvement more than offsets negative wireless margins;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity begins to decline over time, as primary cable - 100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service - and wireless infrastructure upgrades have been completed and revenues continue to grow. However, annual capex spending declines by less than 10% over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF improves from $4.4 billion to $9.4 billion by 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x to 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory given the rating. Charter's financial flexibility will improve in step with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of March 31, 2020 comprised $2.9 billion of cash, and was supported by full availability under its $4.7 billion revolver, $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, and anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturity schedule thorough 2022 is manageable, with $200 million remaining due in 2020, pro forma for the $2.0 billion of 3.579% notes due July 2020 prefunded with 4Q19 debt issuance, $2.0 billion in 2021 and $3.3 billion in 2022. Thereafter, annual bond maturities range from $1.5 billion (2023) to $5.3 billion (2025) through 2030. Charter will have to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to servicing annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Although Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, the company's liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's ability to access the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span> is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon and strong underlying asset value, Fitch does not view structural subordination as impairing recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Thus, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from the IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-14 April 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) assigned to <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (CCOH), <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Operating, LLC</span> (CCO), <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, LLC</span> (TWC) and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (TWCE). Fitch has also affirmed the 'BBB-'/'RR1' senior secured ratings and 'BB+'/'RR4' senior unsecured ratings and assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' rating to CCO's proposed benchmark issuances of senior secured notes. The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter had approximately $78.4 billion of debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2019, including $56.3 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for recent debt issuance and completed and expected debt repurchases, redemptions or repayments. CCOH, CCO, TWC and TWCE are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: Charter is the third-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary) and the second largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Fitch continues to view Charter's May 2016 merger with <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, Inc</span>. (TWC) and acquisition of <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> (the transactions) positively and believes they strengthen Charter's overall credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Charter's 29.2 million customer relationships as of Dec. 31, 2019 position it as one of the largest MVPDs in the U.S., providing the company with significant scale benefits. LTM revenue and EBITDA totalled approximately $45.8 billion and $16.9 billion, respectively. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated gross leverage was 4.6x, while secured leverage was 3.3x for LTM Dec. 31, 2019, pro forma for recent debt issuance and completed and expected debt repurchases, redemptions or repayments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are positively affecting its operating profile, resulting in a strengthened competitive position. The market-share-driven strategy focusing on enhancing the overall competitiveness of its video service and leveraging its expanding all-digital infrastructure is improving subscriber metrics, growing revenue and ARPU, and stabilizing operating margins. Fitch also believes the expansion of Charter's mobile service offerings under a mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. should offer potential future bundling benefits, which should eventually offset the near term infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integration Execution: Charter's ability to manage the simultaneous integration of the transactions while limiting disruptions in existing systems is captured in the company's improved cable operating performance. Although Fitch believes Charter has realized its expected run-rate transaction integration synergies, system-wide wireless rollout costs are expected to be a drag on near-term total margins. However, cable-adjusted EBITDA margins, excluding wireless revenues and operating costs, improved to 40.5% in fourth-quarter 2019 (4Q19) from 37.5% in 4Q17 while cable-adjusted EBITDA of $17.4 billion in fiscal 2019 grew 6.6% over fiscal 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Implications of Coronavirus: Fitch believes the cable sector, including Charter, will be more resilient to a downturn than other sectors given the integral nature of video and broadband services, especially in the current environment, and the industry's predictable recurring payment stream. As such, over the near term Fitch assumes shelter in place requirements will have a positive effect on video and broadband growth, which should more than offset significant declines in the SMB segment and an advertising recession, excluding political, both lasting into 2021. However, although Fitch expects an increase in bad debt expense and ongoing mid-single digit subscriber declines after a slight lull in 2020, the long-term potential for financial damage to the sector and the trajectory of any recovery remain highly uncertain, depending on the severity and duration of the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns (as of Dec. 31, 2019, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.4 billion of its Class A common stock and/or CCH's common units) along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. Fitch does not expect Charter to maintain significant cash balances, resulting in Fitch-calculated total gross leverage roughly equating to total net leverage over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 29.2 million customer relationships, Charter is the third-largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> and U-verse offerings, and <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>. Both <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling, or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within its Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues: Total revenues increase mid-single digits as Fitch expects the coronavirus pandemic to have offsetting effects on Charter's business segments. Near term, Fitch is expecting significant declines in SMB revenues through 2021 as shelter in place requirements increase the potential for companies to go out of business. Advertising is expected to be soft over the same period, while political spending offsets mid to high single digit declines in underlying ad spend in 2020, the absence of political ads in 2021 results in a high single digit overall decline. However, these issues are more than offset by Internet revenue growth, expected in the mid-teens in 2020 due to increased Internet usage and returning to historical mid-single digit increases thereafter. In addition, video revenues are expected to realize continued low single digit growth over the rating horizon, despite ongoing underlying subscriber losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted EBITDA Margins: Total margins improve by almost 100 bp over the rating horizon as continued cable margin improvement more than offsets negative wireless margins;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital intensity begins to decline over time as primary cable (100% digital using DOCSIS 3.1 to offer 1GHz of service) and wireless infrastructure upgrades have been completed and revenues continue to grow. However, annual capex spending declines by less than 10% over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF improves from $4.4 billion to $9.4 billion by 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund maturities and for shareholder returns using debt capacity created by EBITDA growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x to 4.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch excludes M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisitions opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory given the rating. Charter's financial flexibility will improve in step with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of Dec. 31, 2019 comprised $3.5 billion of cash (prefunding February 2020 and July 2020 maturities), and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, and anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturity schedule thorough 2022 is manageable, with $0.3 billion remaining due in 2020 (pro forma for the $2.0 billion of 3.579% notes due July 2020 prefunded with 4Q19 debt issuance), $2.0 billion in 2021 and $3.3 billion in 2022. Thereafter, annual bond maturities range from $1.0 billion (2023) to $5.8 billion (2025) through 2030. Charter will have to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to servicing annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Although Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, the company's liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's ability to access the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon and strong underlying asset value, Fitch does not view structural subordination as impairing recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Thus, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from the Issuer Default Rating.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-04 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BB+'/'RR4' ratings to <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>'s (CCOH) benchmark issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2032. CCOH is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCOH's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Simultaneous with this issuance, CCOH is issuing additional notes under the indenture governing the 4.5% notes due 2030 issued February 2020. The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of certain CCOH indebtedness, potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter, and to pay related fees and expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As of Dec. 31, 2019, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional 1.4 billion of its Class A common stock and/or CCH common units. Charter had approximately $74.9 billion of debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2019, including $52.8 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for this new issuance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. is the third-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary) and the second largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Fitch continues to view Charter's May 2016 merger with <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, Inc</span>. (TWC) and acquisition of <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> (the transactions) positively and believes they strengthen Charter's overall credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Charter's 29.2 million customer relationships as of Dec. 31, 2019 position it as one of the largest MVPDs in the U.S., providing the company with significant scale benefits. LTM revenue and EBITDA totalled approximately $45.8 billion and $16.9 billion, respectively. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated gross leverage was 4.4x, while secured leverage was 3.1x for LTM Dec. 31, 2019, pro forma for expected debt repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are positively affecting its operating profile, resulting in a strengthened competitive position. The market-share-driven strategy focusing on enhancing the overall competitiveness of its video service and leveraging its expanding all-digital infrastructure is improving subscriber metrics, growing revenue and ARPU, and stabilizing operating margins. Fitch also believes the expansion of Charter's mobile service offerings under a mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. should offer potential future bundling benefits, which should eventually offset the near term infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integration Execution: Charter's ability to manage the simultaneous integration of the transactions while limiting disruptions in existing systems is captured in the company's improved cable operating performance. Although Fitch continues to expect Charter to realize the full $1 billion of its expected run-rate transaction integration synergies by 2020, system-wide wireless rollout costs are expected to be a drag on near-term total margins. However, cable-adjusted EBITDA margins, excluding wireless revenues and operating costs, improved to 40.5% in fourth-quarter 2019 (4Q19) from 37.5% in 4Q17. Cable adjusted EBITDA of $17.4 billion in fiscal 2019 grew 6.6% over fiscal 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns (as of Dec. 31, 2019, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.4 billion of its Class A common stock and/or CCH's common units) along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. Fitch does not expect Charter to maintain significant cash balances, resulting in Fitch-calculated total gross leverage roughly equating to total net leverage over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 29.2 million customer relationships, Charter is the third-largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> and U-verse offerings, and <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>. Both <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. The ratings are not affected by country ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Its Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues grow mid-single-digits over the rating horizon driven by an improvement in overall customer relationships and mid-single-digit ARPU growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued low-single-digit video customer declines driven by the increasingly competitive environment;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--HSD customer growth at 5%-7% annually should more than offset video losses, with HSD total revenues surpassing video total revenues over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Wireless revenues are not expected to comprise a significant near-term revenue source;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margin shows slow improvement as integration benefits are offset somewhat by wireless roll out costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex at low 20% as a percentage of revenues due to system-wide wireless infrastructure investments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter grows FCF to $4.5 billion by 2021 from $2.7 billion in 2018;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund annual maturities and take advantage of debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x-4.5x creating approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of additional annual debt capacity for either shareholder returns or accretive acquisitions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual shareholder returns are expected to grow to $9.6 billion by 2021 from $6.3 billion in 2018;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch does not include any M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory given the rating. Charter's financial flexibility will improve in step with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of Dec. 31, 2019 comprised $3.5 billion of cash and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, and anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturity schedule thorough 2022 is manageable, with $0.3 billion remaining due in 2020 (pro forma for the repayment of its $1.5 billion of 5.000% notes due February 2020 and $2.0 billion of 3.579% notes due July 2020 that were prefunded with debt issuance in 4Q19), $2.0 billion in 2021 and $4.5 billion in 2022. Thereafter, annual bond maturities range from $2.8 billion (2029) to $5.3 billion (2025) through 2029. Charter will have to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to servicing annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Although Fitch expects Charter could access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, the company's liquidity profile might be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's ability to access the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon and strong underlying asset value, Fitch does not view structural subordination as impairing recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Thus, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from the Issuer Default Rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security.

Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-03 February 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BB+'/'RR4' ratings to <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>'s (CCOH) benchmark issuance of senior unsecured notes due 2030. CCOH is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. (Charter). CCOH's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company is expected to use net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of certain indebtedness, potential buybacks of Class A common stock of Charter or common units of <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b> Holdings, LLC</span> (CCH), a subsidiary of Charter , and to pay related fees and expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As of Dec. 31, 2019, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase an additional 1.4 billion of its Class A common stock and/or CCH common units. Charter had approximately $74.9 billion of debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2019, including $52.8 billion of senior secured debt, pro forma for expected debt repayment using net proceeds from debt issuance in 4Q19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Position: <span class="companylink"><b>Charter Communications</b>, Inc</span>. is the third-largest multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) in the U.S. behind <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> subsidiary) and the second largest cable MVPD behind <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>. Fitch continues to view Charter's May 2016 merger with <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable, Inc</span>. (TWC) and acquisition of <span class="companylink">Bright House Networks, LLC</span> (the transactions) positively and believes they strengthen Charter's overall credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Profile: Charter's 29.2 million customer relationships as of Dec. 31, 2019 position it as one of the largest MVPDs in the U.S., providing the company with significant scale benefits. LTM revenue and EBITDA totalled approximately $45.8 billion and $16.9 billion, respectively. Fitch estimates total Fitch-calculated gross leverage was 4.4x, while secured leverage was 3.1x for LTM Dec. 31, 2019, pro forma for expected debt repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are positively affecting its operating profile, resulting in a strengthened competitive position. The market-share-driven strategy focusing on enhancing the overall competitiveness of its video service and leveraging its expanding all-digital infrastructure is improving subscriber metrics, growing revenue and ARPU, and stabilizing operating margins. Fitch also believes the expansion of Charter's mobile service offerings under a mobile virtual network operator agreement with <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. should offer potential future bundling benefits, which should eventually offset the near term infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integration Execution: Charter's ability to manage the simultaneous integration of the transactions while limiting disruptions in existing systems is captured in the company's improved cable operating performance. Although Fitch continues to expect Charter to realize the full $1 billion of its expected run-rate transaction integration synergies by 2020, system-wide wireless rollout costs are expected to be a drag on near-term total margins. However, cable-adjusted EBITDA margins, excluding wireless revenues and operating costs, improved to 40.5% in fourth-quarter 2019 (4Q19) from 37.5% in 4Q17 . Cable adjusted EBITDA of $17.4 billion in FY19 grew 6.6% over FY18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Capacity Growth: Charter maintains a target net leverage range of 4.0x‒4.5x and up to 3.5x senior secured leverage. Fitch expects Charter to continue creating debt capacity and remain within its target leverage, primarily through EBITDA growth. Proceeds from prospective debt issuances under debt capacity created are expected to be used for shareholder returns (as of Dec. 31, 2019, Charter's stock buyback program had authority to purchase up to $1.4 billion of its Class A common stock and/or CCH's common units) along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. Fitch does not expect Charter to maintain significant cash balances, resulting in Fitch-calculated total gross leverage roughly equating to total net leverage over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter is well positioned in the MVPD space given its size and geographic diversity. With 29.2 million customer relationships, Charter is the third-largest U.S. MVPD after <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>., through its <span class="companylink">DirecTV</span> and U-verse offerings, and <span class="companylink">Comcast Corporation</span>. Both <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> (A-/Stable) are rated higher than Charter due primarily to lower target and actual total leverage levels and significantly greater revenue size, coverage area and segment diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's ratings should be held in check as the company expects to continue issuing debt under additional debt capacity created by EBITDA growth while remaining within its target total net leverage range of 4.0x-4.5x. Proceeds from prospective debt issuance under this additional debt capacity are expected to be used for shareholder returns along with internal investment and accretive acquisitions. No country ceiling, or parent/subsidiary aspects affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Its Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues grow mid-single-digits over the rating horizon driven by an improvement in overall customer relationships and mid-single-digit ARPU growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued low-single-digit video customer declines driven by the increasingly competitive environment;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--HSD customer growth at 5%-7% annually should more than offset video losses, with HSD total revenues surpassing video total revenues over the rating horizon;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Wireless revenues are not expected to comprise a significant near-term revenue source;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margin shows slow improvement as integration benefits are offset somewhat by wireless roll out costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex at low 20% as a percentage of revenues due to system-wide wireless infrastructure investments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter grows FCF to $4.5 billion by 2021 from $2.7 billion in 2018;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Charter issues sufficient debt to fund annual maturities and take advantage of debt capacity created by EBITDA growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects Charter to remain at the high end of its target net leverage of 4.0x-4.5x creating approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of additional annual debt capacity for either shareholder returns or accretive acquisitions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual shareholder returns are expected to grow to $9.6 billion by 2021 from $6.3 billion in 2018;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch does not include any M&A activity given the lack of transformational acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating continued progress in closing gaps relative to industry peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A strengthening operating profile as the company captures sustainable revenue and cash flow growth, and the reduction and maintenance of total leverage below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A leveraging transaction or adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that increases leverage over 5.0x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Perceived weakening of its competitive position or failure of the current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue, cash flow growth and strengthening operating margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as satisfactory given the rating. Charter's financial flexibility will improve in step with the continued growth in FCF generation. The company's liquidity position as of Dec. 31, 2019 comprised $3.5 billion of cash and was supported by full availability under its $4.75 billion revolver, $249 million of which matures in March 2023 and $4.5 billion in February 2025, and anticipated FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Charter's maturity schedule thorough 2022 is manageable, with $0.3 billion remaining due in 2020 (pro forma for the repayment of its $1.5 billion of 5.000% notes due February 2020 and $2.0 billion of 3.579% notes due July 2020 that were prefunded with debt issuance in 4Q19), $2.0 billion in 2021 and $4.5 billion in 2022. Thereafter, annual bond maturities range from $2.8 billion (2029) to $5.3 billion (2025) through 2029. Charter will have to dedicate a significant portion of potential debt issuance during that period to servicing annual maturities, which could reduce cash available for share repurchases, especially in the event of market dislocation. Although Fitch expects Charter would be able to access capital markets to meet its upcoming maturities, the company's liquidity profile could be weakened if a market dislocation is severe enough to hinder the company's ability to access the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >CCO is the public issuer of Charter's senior secured debt, and CCOH is the public issuer of Charter's senior unsecured debt. All of CCO's existing and future secured debt is secured by a first-priority interest in all of CCO's assets and is guaranteed by all of CCO's subsidiaries, including those that hold the assets of Charter, TWC, Bright House and CCOH. All of CCOH's existing and future debt is structurally subordinated to CCO's senior secured debt and is neither guaranteed by nor pari passu with any secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With Charter's Fitch-calculated secured leverage expected to remain below 4.0x over the rating horizon and strong underlying asset value, Fitch does not view structural subordination as impairing recovery prospects at the unsecured level. Thus, Charter's unsecured notes are not notched down from the Issuer Default Rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Date of Relevant Committee</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >16 October 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>
