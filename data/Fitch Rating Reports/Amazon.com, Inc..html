<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-03 July 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed all of <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b>.</span>'s ratings, including its 'AA-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), 'F1+' Short-Term IDR and CP ratings, and its 'AA-' ratings for its unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ratings reflect its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with $139 billion in 2024 EBITDA, strong FCF generation, and reasonable EBITDAR leverage that is expected to trend below 2.0x. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has a successful track record of executing its strategic vision, and its flexible operating platform provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term strategic path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices. However, these risks are mitigated by the company's significant financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s financial profile has improved in recent years. Annual revenue growth averaged about 18% over the past five years, with around 25% average annual growth in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s high-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. EBITDA consequently expanded to $139 billion in 2024 (21.8% of revenue) from $33 billion in 2015 (14.2% of revenue). EBITDA growth has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. For the three years ended in 2020, FCF averaged $22 billion (adding back lease depreciation, which is in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s FCF calculation) after an average of $23 billion spent on capex. FCF through and after the pandemic was somewhat volatile, with negative FCF in 2021 and 2022 as the company ramped up inventory and capex to support demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Medium-term EBITDA growth could average close to 10%, given faster revenue growth in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. EBITDAR leverage, which was 0.9x in 2024, could remain below 2.0x in the medium term. However, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> could use debt-financed investments, including M&A to support its long-term growth ambitions. FCF adding back lease depreciation was about $33 billion in 2024 and could be about $20 billion in 2025, assuming capex grows to about $100 billion from $83 billion in 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth to continue at a strong, but moderating pace given the company's scale, with high-single-digit revenue growth annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Near-Term Challenges: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the U.S. retail sector to face near-term challenges, including declines in consumer sentiment, business disruption, and rising costs related to evolving U.S. tariff policies. Revenue from discretionary categories could drop by mid-single digits, with outsized EBITDA declines given tariff-related cost pressures. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects U.S. retailers to be affected by these challenges, but <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s value price positioning and business diversification should allow it to manage through near-term volatility better than most of its competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Positions: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company's innovations have increased customer confidence in online purchases, and it has created a suite of capabilities that other companies have attempted to emulate. <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (<span class="companylink">AWS</span>) began as <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s internal platform to support its growing online retail business and later established the cloud computing industry. The company's success has led to exponential growth in its EBITDA, FCF and cash position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Suite of Assets: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s leadership position and scale, along with strong strategy and execution, have driven a cycle of growth and investment for the company. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength. These attributes allow the company to quickly implement changes and expand its operations beyond what traditional retailers or technology firms can achieve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s innovation has helped to establish new industry verticals and exposed it to several high-growth markets such as cloud services, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the cloud services market could grow at least 10% annually in the medium term. E-commerce growth should reach the high-single digits, modestly below its recent low-teens pace, as digital penetration across retail categories matures. Its AI investments are in the early stage, but <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> expects significant growth opportunities over time through hardware, models, and applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic-Growth Path: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has pursued or has been reported to have been interested in various opportunities both related to and outside its main business lines. These include generative AI, logistics, voice recognition applications, smart home capabilities, healthcare, media, and financial services. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has a strong track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, but it has also made outsized growth investments. Examples include the $13.7 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> in 2017, the $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios (<span class="companylink">MGM Holdings Inc.</span>) in 2022 and the $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical (1 Life Healthcare, Inc.) in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Political discussion around Big Tech has prompted speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>. Outcomes of inquiries in the U.S. and the <span class="companylink">EU</span> could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which, in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s case, could include a breakup of the company. In September 2023, the <span class="companylink">Federal Trade Commission</span> sued <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, alleging it undertook activities to maintain monopoly power. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s rated retail/omnichannel peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc.</span> (AA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A/Negative). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with nearly $681 billion of 2024 revenue, positive comparable store sales trend, substantial cash flow and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage of around 2x over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s 2018 EBITDA of $33 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage at around 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> consider its smaller scale at just over $107 billion in revenue, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins and historically similar leverage profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> compares against cloud service industry peers, including <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> (BBB/Stable). From an Infrastructure-as-a- Service perspective, <span class="companylink">AWS</span> has a much larger scale (over 30% share globally). However, <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> has significant legacy enterprise products that support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings, with over $50 billion in annual revenues and reflects its solid position in the Enterprise Resource Planning segment that provides substantial cash generation, with EBITDA leverage expected to sustain near 3.5x in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects annual organic revenue growth for the North American division (primarily ecommerce, 61% and 39% of 2024 revenue and subsector EBITDA, respectively), which averaged about 11.5% over the past three years, to moderate to the high-single-digit range beginning 2026, given some maturing of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s business from a nearly $390 billion revenue base in 2024. Revenue growth could be in the low single digits in 2025, given a projected pullback in discretionary spending;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- North America EBITDA margins (all segment EBITDA is calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> and is prior to allocated lease depreciation and stock option expense add-backs), which rebounded to about 10% in 2024 following a 2.8% trough in 2022 on industrywide supply chain challenges and cost inflation, could trend in the high 9% range beginning in 2025. EBITDA, which was about $40 billion in 2024, could, therefore, trend in the $40 billion to $45 billion range over the next two years compared to about $9 billion in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Revenue growth at <span class="companylink">AWS</span> (22% and 53% of 2024 revenue and segment EBITDA, respectively), which has averaged about 20% over the past three years, is expected be about 10%, in line with our forecast for medium-term cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend near 50%, similar to pre-pandemic levels and 2024. This would result in EBITDA expanding toward $65 billion in 2026 from $53 billion in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- International segment (17% and 8% of 2024 revenue and subsector EBITDA, respectively) revenue growth could be in the mid-single digits in the long term. Subsector revenues historically rose at a far higher rate, including a 25% average in 2019-2021, but declined nearly 8% in 2022 before rebounding 11% in 2023 and 9% in 2024, partly due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on reported results. EBITDA is expected to remain stable at around the $8 billion recorded in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth near 5% in 2025 and 8% in 2026, with consolidated revenue expected to reach $720 billion by 2026 from $638 billion in 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects EBITDA to rise above $150 billion by 2026 from about $139 billion in 2024, as EBITDA margins remain near the current 22% level;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Cash flow from operations (CFO), which was $112 billion in 2024, could expand toward $140 billion in 2026 given EBITDA growth. FCF adding back lease depreciation, which was about $30 billion in 2024, could decline toward $20 billion in 2025, assuming an expansion to $100 billion from $83 billion in 2024. Beginning in 2026, FCF will be a function of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s decisions around capex investments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- EBITDAR leverage, which has trended around 2.0x between 2018 and 2022 before moderating to close to 1.0x in 2023 and 2024 on EBITDA growth and some debt reduction, is expected to remain below 2.0x given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA assumptions and assuming stable debt levels. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow to invest in its business, the company could still pursue debt-financed transactions, such as the <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case assumes EBITDAR leverage remains below 2.5x over the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s committed facilities have a floating interest rate structure and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes about 3.5% to 5% base rates over the forecast horizon, given higher interest rates. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s notes have a fixed interest rate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- A material slowdown in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth trajectory, with EBITDAR leverage sustained near 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizable investments in new business verticals that limit EBITDA expansion, or debt-financed M&A;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The outcome of any regulatory activity that adversely affects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- A publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in EBITDAR leverage sustaining under 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Operating performance that is better than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current expectations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> would be able to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly related to future growth platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s liquidity as of March 31, 2025, included $66.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company has a $30 billion CP program, undrawn as of March 31, 2025, which is backed by cash and its revolvers, including its $15 billion unsecured RCF due November 2028 and its 364-day, $5 billion unsecured revolver due October 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects CP usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Following repayments of April 2025 and June 2025 maturities, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s debt includes about $55 billion of unsecured notes, including $2.25 billion due in December 2025 and $2.75 billion due April 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s unsecured debt balance could increase over time to support growth initiatives, although it could use FCF to reduce debt as it has sometimes done previously. The company could also issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition in 2017. The company began a share repurchase program in 2022, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes there will be about $5 billion of buybacks annually. However, the company did not repurchase shares in 2024 or 1Q25, and has not indicated plans to resume share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-28 June 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed all of <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b>.</span>'s ratings, including its 'AA-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), 'F1+' Short-Term IDR and CP ratings, and its 'AA-' ratings for its unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ratings reflect its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with $103 billion in 2023 EBITDA, strong FCF generation and reasonable EBITDAR leverage expected to trend below 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has a successful track record of executing its strategic vision, and its flexible operating platform provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term strategic path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices. However, though these risks are somewhat mitigated by the company's significant financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Positions: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company's innovations have increased customer confidence in online purchases, and it has created a suite of capabilities that other companies have attempted to emulate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (<span class="companylink">AWS</span>), which grew out of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s internal efforts to service its growing online retail business, has similarly helped establish the cloud computing industry offerings. The company's success has led to exponential growth in its EBITDA, FCF and cash position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Suite of Assets: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s leadership position and scale, supported by good strategic foresight and execution, have created a virtuous circle of growth and investment for the company. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These attributes provide the company with maneuverability to quickly execute changes and an ability to expand its operation in ways not traditionally possible for either retailers or technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s path-forging has helped to establish new industry verticals, but also exposed it to several high-growth markets including cloud services and e-commerce. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the cloud services market could grow at least 10% annually in the medium term. E-commerce growth could be in the high single digits, which is modestly lower than its recent track record in the low-teens, due to signs of maturation in digital penetration across retail categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s financial profile has improved in recent years across a number of metrics. Annual revenue has grown at an average of 20% over the past five years, with around 29% average annual growth in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s high-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. As a result of revenue growth, EBITDA expanded to $103 billion in 2023 (18.0% of revenue) from $33 billion in 2015 (14.2% of revenue).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth in EBITDA has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. For the three years ending in 2020, FCF averaged $22 billion (adding back lease depreciation which is in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s FCF calculation) after an average of $23 billion spent on capex. FCF through the pandemic and its aftermath was somewhat volatile, with negative FCF in 2021/2022 as the company ramped up inventory and capex to support demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF adding back lease depreciation turned positive at about $32 billion in 2023 and could grow with EBITDA, surpassing $50 billion by 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth to continue at a strong, albeit moderating, pace given the company's scale, with high single digit revenue growth annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA growth could average closer to 10%, given relatively faster revenue growth in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. EBITDAR leverage, which was 1.6x in 2023, could remain below 2.0x over the medium term based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA and FCF expectations. However, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> could use debt-financed investments, including M&A to support its longer-term growth ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic-Growth Path: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has made inroads or has been reported to have been interested in various opportunities both adjacent to its current verticals and somewhat afield of its major business lines. These verticals include generative artificial intelligence, logistics, voice recognition applications, smart home capabilities, healthcare services, media and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has a proven track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, it has also made outsized growth investments. The company has made large investments in areas that could be significantly margin dilutive with a longer-term investment time horizon. Recent examples include the $13.7 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> in 2017, the $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios (<span class="companylink">MGM Holdings Inc.</span>) in 2022 and the $3.5 billion acquisition of One Medical (1 Life Healthcare, Inc.) in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> invests in new avenues of growth, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects its existing e-commerce and <span class="companylink">AWS</span> businesses will be the primary source of cash flow and earnings for the foreseeable future. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has ample ability to invest in its existing business platform through internally generated cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Political discussion around Big Tech has prompted speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>. Outcomes of inquiries in the U.S. and the <span class="companylink">EU</span> could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which, in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s case, could include a breakup of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In September 2023, the <span class="companylink">Federal Trade Commission</span> sued <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, alleging it undertook activities to maintain monopoly power. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has denied any wrongdoing. Fines or other penalties could be levied if the company was found to commit any wrongdoing relative to competitive practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s rated retail/omnichannel peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc.</span> (AA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A/Stable). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with nearly $650 billion of 2023 revenue, positive comparable store sales trend, substantial cash flow and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage of around 2x over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s 2018 EBITDA of $33 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has significantly greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage at around 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> consider its smaller scale at $107 billion in 2023 revenue, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins and historically similar leverage profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> compares against cloud service industry peers, including <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> (BBB/Stable). From an Infrastructure-as-a-Service perspective, <span class="companylink">AWS</span> has a much larger scale (over 30% share globally). However, <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> has significant legacy enterprise products that support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings -- with over $50 billion in annual revenues -- reflect its solid position in the Enterprise Resource Planning segment that provides substantial cash generation, with EBITDA leverage expected to sustain near 3.5x in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also compares <span class="companylink">AWS</span> against <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corporation</span> (Not Rated) as Azure is the largest direct competitor in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service segment, and a major provider of Software-as-a-Service. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s IaaS scale remains below that of <span class="companylink">AWS</span>; however, its growth rates continue to outpace <span class="companylink">AWS</span>. When combined with SaaS, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> is a significant competitor in the cloud services industry. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the recent interest around LLM generative AI could offer an additional opportunity for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> to continue closing the gap in IaaS against <span class="companylink">AWS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates annual organic revenue growth for the North American division (primarily ecommerce, 61% and 43% of 2023 revenue and segment EBITDA, respectively), which averaged approximately 14% over the past three years, to moderate to the high single digit range over the next two years given some maturation of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s business from a $350 billion revenue base in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America EBITDA margins (prior to allocated lease D&A and stock option expense add-backs), which rebounded to about 8% in 2023 following a 2.8% trough in 2022 on industry-wide supply chain challenges and cost inflation, could trend in the low 8% range beginning in 2024. EBITDA, which was nearly $30 billion in 2023, could therefore trend in the low to mid $30 billion range over the next two years from approximately $9 billion in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth at <span class="companylink">AWS</span> (16% and 55% of 2023 revenue and segment EBITDA, respectively), which has averaged about 26% over the past three years, is expected be around 10% to low-teens annually, in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for medium term cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend in the 43% range, below pre-pandemic levels around 50% given increased investments and similar to the 41% range recorded in 2022/2023. This would yield EBITDA expanding toward $50 billion in 2025 from $37 billion in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--International segment (23% and 2% of 2023 revenue and segment EBITDA, respectively) revenue growth could be in the low to mid-single digits longer term. Segment revenues historically grew at a significantly higher rate, including a 25% average in 2019-2021, although reversed to a decline of nearly 8% in 2022 before rebounding 11% in 2023 partly due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on reported results. EBITDA is expected to remain modestly negative, as it was in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth in the 8% range, with consolidated revenue expected to reach $675 billion by 2025 from $575 billion in 2023. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects EBITDA to grow above $130 billion by 2025 from approximately $103 billion in 2023, as EBITDA margins improve toward 20% from the current 18% range given faster growth in the higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow from operations, which was $79 billion in 2022, could be just above $100 billion in 2024 assuming some EBITDA growth and less working capital growth. FCF (adding back lease depreciation), which was $32 billion in 2023, could improve alongside EBITDA growth, reaching the $51 billion range by 2025. This assumes capex grows to around $70 billion beginning in 2024 from the approximately $60 billion three-year average. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA and FCF calculations are reduced for non-cash finance lease depreciation expense, which was about $6 billion in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR leverage which has trended around 2.0x between 2018 and 2022 before moderating to 1.6x in 2023 on EBITDA growth and some debt reduction, is expected to remain below 2.0x given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA assumptions and assuming flattish debt levels. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow with which to invest in its business, the company could make leveraging transactions, such as the <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case assumes EBITDAR leverage remains below 2.5x longer term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s committed facilities have a floating interest rate structure and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes around 3.5% to 5% base rates over the forecast horizon, given the higher interest rate environment. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s notes have a fixed interest rate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in EBITDAR leverage sustaining under 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating performance that is better than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current expectations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> would be able to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly with regard to future growth platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material slowdown in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth trajectory with EBITDAR leverage sustained near 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizable investments in new business verticals that limit EBITDA expansion or debt-financed M&A. The outcome of any regulatory activity that adversely affects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile would also be a potential credit risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s liquidity as of March 31, 2024 was primarily composed of its reported $72.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company's short-term investments are reported as marketable securities, consisting of government and agency bonds, 'AAA' rated money market funds, investment-grade fixed-income securities and equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2018, the company initiated a $7 billion CP program, subsequently upsized to $10 billion in June 2020 and to $20 billion in March 2021; the program is backed by cash and its revolvers, including its $15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due November 2028 and its 364-day, $5 billion unsecured revolver due October 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects CP usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings. As of March 31, 2024, the company had no outstanding CP borrowings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company also has a $352 million credit facility, fully drawn as of March 2024 and available through August 2025; this facility is secured by certain seller receivables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b>.</span> is the issuer of all debt, including its unsecured revolvers, CP program, and $66.5 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding as of March 31, 2024. The company has $4.5 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing between August and December of 2024 with another $5 billion of unsecured notes due in 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has chosen to enter into finance leases (formerly termed capital leases), generally with three- to five-year terms, for some of its infrastructure, particularly equipment supporting <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, given its low cost of capital and desire to preserve cash for investment optionality. Per <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, the company's finance lease arrangements are capitalized at 4.0x annual operating expenses (including amortization and interest).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Finance lease amortization and interest expense, like operating lease expense, are now considered operating expenses by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> and reduce EBITDA and FCF; these expenses, which were $5.9 billion in 2023, should decline over time as capital leases roll off, and are added back to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDAR calculation and added to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s financing cash flow calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s unsecured debt balance could increase over time to support growth initiatives, although it could use FCF to reduce debt as it has sometimes done previously. The company could also issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition in 2017. The company began a share repurchase program in 2022, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes there will be about $5 billion of buybacks annually. However, the company did not repurchase shares in 2023 or 1Q24 and has not indicated plans to resume share repurchase in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is a global leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing services, with $575 billion in 2023 revenue and over $103 billion in 2023 EBITDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has adjusted the historical debt by adding 8x the annual operating lease expense and 4x the annual finance lease expense. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, which totaled $24 billion in 2023.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-20 June 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed all of <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>.'s ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-' and its Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s Long-Term IDR reflects its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with $67 billion in 2022 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable EBITDAR leverage expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks are somewhat mitigated given increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Positions from Superior Strategy and Execution: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company's innovations provided customers greater comfort in making online purchases and have forged a path of capabilities that others have strived to emulate. <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (<span class="companylink">AWS</span>), which grew out of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s internal efforts to service its growing online retail business, has similarly helped to establish the cloud computing industry offerings. The company's success has led to exponential growth in its EBITDA, FCF and cash position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Connections and Suite of Assets Yield Operating Flexibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s leadership position and scale, supported by good strategic foresight and execution, have created a virtuous circle of growth and investment for the company. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength. These attributes provide the company maneuverability to quickly execute changes and an ability to expand its operation in ways not traditionally seen for either retailers or technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets and Verticals: Partly a result of its own path-forging that helped to establish new industry verticals, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is exposed to several high-growth markets including cloud services and e-commerce. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the cloud services market could grow roughly low-teens annually in the medium term, while e-commerce growth could be around 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s financial profile has improved in recent years across a number of metrics. Annual revenue has grown at an average of 24% over the past five years, with around 35% average annual growth in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s high-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. As a result of revenue growth, EBITDA expanded to $67 billion in 2022 (13.1% of revenue) from $10.6 billion in 2015 (9.9% of revenue).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth in EBITDA has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. For the three years ended 2020, FCF averaged $22 billion (adding back lease depreciation which is in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s FCF calculation) after an average $23 billion spent on capex. FCF on the same basis turned negative in 2021 at around $15 billion and negative $17 billion in 2022 given a significant ramp in inventory and capex but could turn positive in the $10 billion to $15 billion range in 2023, assuming neutral working capital.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth to continue at a strong, albeit moderating, pace given the company's scale and some near-term softening macroeconomic trends, with approximately 10% to low-teens revenue growth expected annually. EBITDA growth could be in the mid-single digits in 2023 given slower growth and ongoing cost pressures, but accelerate thereafter assuming some stabilization in cost and supply chain inflation. EBITDAR leverage is expected to trend around 2.0x, close to where the company has operated for the past four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic Growth Path: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has either made inroads in, or is rumored to be interested in, a number of opportunities both adjacent to its current verticals and somewhat afield of its major business lines. These verticals include logistics, voice recognition applications, smart home capabilities, healthcare services, media and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While the company has a proven track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has also made outsized growth investments. The company has shown comfort in and propensity to make large investments in areas that could be significantly margin dilutive with a longer-term investment time horizon. Recent examples include the $13.7 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> in 2017, the $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios (<span class="companylink">MGM Holdings Inc</span>.) in 2022 and the $3.5 billion acquisition of One Medical (1 Life Healthcare, Inc.) in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> invests in new avenues of growth, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects its existing e-commerce and <span class="companylink">AWS</span> businesses will be the primary source of cash flow and earnings for the foreseeable future. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has ample ability to invest in its existing business platform through internally generated cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Political discussion around Big Tech has prompted speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>. Outcomes of inquiries in the U.S. and the <span class="companylink">EU</span> could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which, in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s case, could include a breakup of the company. Fines or other penalties could be levied if the company was found to commit any wrongdoing relative to competitive practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ratings reflect its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with $67 billion in 2022 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with EBITDAR leverage expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks have been somewhat mitigated in recent years given <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s rated retail/omnichannel peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. (AA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A/Stable). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with over $600 billion of 2022 revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage of around 2x over time. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s 2018 EBITDA of $33 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has significantly greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage around 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> consider its smaller scale at $109 billion in 2022 revenue, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins and historically similar leverage profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> compares against cloud service industry peers, including <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> (BBB/Negative). From an Infrastructure-as-a-Service perspective, <span class="companylink">AWS</span> has a substantially larger scale (over 30% share globally) than <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>. However, <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> has significant legacy enterprise products that are able to support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings -- with over $40 billion in annual revenues -- reflect its solid position in the Enterprise Resource Planning segment that provides substantial cash generation, with EBITDA leverage expected to sustain above 3.5x in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also compares <span class="companylink">AWS</span> against <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corporation</span> (Not Rated) as Azure is the largest direct competitor in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service segment, and a major provider of Software-as-a-Service. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s IaaS scale remains below that of <span class="companylink">AWS</span>; however, its growth rates continue to outpace <span class="companylink">AWS</span>. When combined with SaaS, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> is a significant competitor in the cloud services industry. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the recent interest around LLM generative AI could offer an additional opportunity for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> to continue closing the gap in IaaS against <span class="companylink">AWS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates annual organic revenue growth for the North American division (primarily ecommerce, 61% and 23% of 2022 revenue and segment EBITDA, respectively), which averaged approximately 23% over the past three years, to moderate to the 8% to 10% range over the next two years given some softening in consumer goods spending and expectations of slower digital channel growth following recently strong years supported by pandemic-related shopping behavior;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America EBITDA margins (prior to allocated lease D&A and stock option expense add-backs), which were around 6% in 2020/2021 before declining to around 3% in 2022 on industry-wide supply chain challenges and cost inflation, could remain muted around 3% in 2023/2024. EBITDA could therefore average around $10 billion over the next two years from approximately $9 billion in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth at <span class="companylink">AWS</span> (16% and 88% of 2022 revenue and segment EBITDA, respectively), which has averaged about 32% over the past three years, is expected be around 10% to 15% annually, in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for medium term cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend in the 37% range, modestly below recent history given some slowdown in topline growth, yielding EBITDA expanding to around $38 billion in 2024 from $33 billion in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--International segment (23% and -11% of 2022 revenue and segment EBITDA, respectively) revenue growth could be in the low to mid-single digits longer term. Segment revenues historically grew at a significantly higher rate, including a 25% average in 2019-2021, although reversed to a decline of nearly 8% in 2022 partly due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on reported results. Constant currency revenue declined 4% in 2022 given pricing actions, somewhat mitigated by positive volume growth. EBITDA is expected to be around negative $5 billion to $6 billion annually, similar to 2022 EBITDA of negative $4 billion;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth in the 8% to 9% range, with consolidated revenue expected to exceed $600 billion by 2024 from $514 billion in 2022. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects EBITDA to grow above $80 billion by 2024 from approximately $67 billion in 2022, as EBITDA margins improve toward 14% from the current 13% range given faster growth in the higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow from operations, which was $41 billion in 2022, could be near $70 billion in 2023 assuming some EBITDA growth and neutral working capital (which was a use of $20 billion in both 2021 and 2022). FCF, which was an outflow of $23 billion in 2022 largely due to working capital usage, could improve to an inflow of around $9 billion in 2023 assuming neutral working capital. Cash flow could expand further in 2024 from these figures given some EBITDA growth. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA and FCF calculations are reduced for non-cash finance lease depreciation expense, which was around $6 billion in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR leverage which has trended around 2.0x since 2018, is expected to sustain in this range over the next two years. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow with which to invest in its business, the company could make temporarily leveraging transactions such as the <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s committed facilities have a floating interest rate structure and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes around 3.5% to 5% base rates over the forecast horizon, given the higher interest rate environment. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s notes have a fixed interest rate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in EBITDAR leverage sustaining under 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating performance that is better than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current expectations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increased confidence in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ability to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly with regard to future growth platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material slowdown in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth trajectory with EBITDAR leverage sustained near 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizable investments in new business verticals that limit EBITDA expansion or debt-financed M&A. The outcome of any regulatory activity that would adversely affect <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile would also be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s liquidity as of March 31, 2023 was primarily composed of its reported $49.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company's short-term investments are reported as marketable securities, consisting of government and agency bonds, 'AAA' rated money market funds, investment-grade fixed-income securities and equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2018, the company initiated a $7 billion CP program, subsequently upsized to $10 billion in June 2020 and to $20 billion in March 2021; the program is backed by its $10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due March 2025 and cash. In November 2022, the company obtained a 364-day, $10 billion unsecured revolver to further bolster liquidity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects CP usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings. As of March 31, 2023, the company had $7.8 billion of outstanding CP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. is the issuer of all debt, including its unsecured revolver, CP program, $8 billion, 364-day term loan and approximately $70 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding as of March 31, 2023. The company has $8.5 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has chosen to enter into finance leases (formerly termed capital leases), generally with three- to five-year terms, for some of its infrastructure, particularly equipment supporting <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, given its low cost of capital and desire to preserve cash for investment optionality. Per <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, the company's finance lease arrangements are capitalized at 4.0x annual operating expenses (including amortization and interest).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Finance lease amortization and interest expense, like operating lease expense, are now considered operating expenses by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> and reduce EBITDA and FCF; these expenses, which were $6.1 billion in 2022, should decline over time as capital leases roll off, and are added back to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDAR calculation and added to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s financing cash flow calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s unsecured debt balance could grow over time to support growth initiatives, although <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> could use FCF to reduce debt as it has on occasion in the past. Alternatively, the company could choose to issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition in 2017. The company began a share repurchase program in 2022 and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes around $5 billion of buybacks annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is a global leader in both e-commerce and cloud compute services, with $514 billion in 2022 revenue and over $67 billion in 2022 EBITDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has adjusted the historical debt by adding 8x annual operating lease expense and 4x annual finance lease expense. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also adjusts for stock-based compensation expense, which totaled $19.6 billion in 2022.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-29 November 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'AA-' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>.'s proposed unsecured notes issuance. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital and capex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s 'AA-'/Stable Long-Term Issuer Default Rating reflects its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with over $60 billion in 2021 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable adjusted leverage expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks have been somewhat mitigated recently given increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Positions from Superior Strategy and Execution: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company's innovations provided customers greater comfort in making online purchases but also forged a path of capabilities that others have strived to emulate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (<span class="companylink">AWS</span>), which grew out of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s internal efforts to service its growing online retail business, has similarly helped to establish the cloud computing industry offerings. The company's success has led to exponential growth in its EBITDA, FCF and cash position. In 2021, the company generated $62 billion of Fitch-defined EBITDA; the company has generated an average of around $8 billion in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> defined FCF over the past four years despite spending over $130 billion in capex during that time. The company ended 2021 with $72 billion of Fitch-defined cash and equivalents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Connections and Suite of Assets Yield Operating Flexibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s leadership position and scale, supported by good strategic foresight and execution, have created a virtuous circle of growth and investment for the company. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength. These attributes provide the company maneuverability to quickly execute changes and an ability to expand its operation in ways not traditionally seen for either retailers or technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets and Verticals: Partly a result of its own path-forging that helped to establish new industry verticals, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is exposed to several high-growth markets including cloud services and e-commerce. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the cloud services market could grow roughly 25% annually in the medium term, while e-commerce growth could be in the low double digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s financial profile has improved in recent years across a number of metrics. Annual revenue has grown at an average of nearly 30% over the past five years, with close to 40% average annual growth in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s high-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. As a result of revenue growth, EBITDA expanded to $62 billion in 2021 (13.1% of revenue) from $10.6 billion in 2015 (9.9% of revenue).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth in EBITDA has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. For the three years ended 2020, FCF averaged $22 billion (adding back lease depreciation which is in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s FCF calculation) after an average $23 billion spent on capex. FCF on the same basis turned negative in 2021 at around $15 billion given a significant ramp in inventory and capex and could remain negative in the negative $10 billion to negative $15 range although improve toward modestly positive breakeven by 2024, assuming neutral working capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth to continue at a strong, albeit moderating, pace given the company's scale and some near-term softening macroeconomic trends, with approximately 10% to low-teens revenue growth expected annually. EBITDA growth could be around 8% in 2023 given slower growth and ongoing cost pressures, but improve to the mid-teens beginning 2024 given stronger growth in the company's higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend around 2.0x, close to where the company has operated for the past three years, following the modestly leveraging acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic Growth Path: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has either made inroads in, or is rumored to be interested in, a number of opportunities both adjacent to its current verticals and somewhat afield of its major business lines. These verticals include logistics, voice recognition applications, smart home capabilities, healthcare services, media and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While the company has a proven track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has also made outsized growth investments. The company has shown comfort in and propensity to make large investments in areas that could be significantly margin dilutive with a longer-term investment time horizon. Recent examples include the $13.7 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> in 2017 and the $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios (<span class="companylink">MGM Holdings Inc</span>.) in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to look toward new avenues of growth, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s primary source of cash flow and earnings is expected to remain its existing e-commerce and <span class="companylink">AWS</span> businesses, for the foreseeable future. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has ample ability to invest in its business through internally generated cash flow, although the rating case incorporates room for the company to make outsized investments or acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Political discussion around Big Tech has prompted speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>. Outcomes of inquiries in the U.S. and the <span class="companylink">EU</span> could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which, in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s case, could include a breakup of the company. Fines or other penalties could be levied if the company was found to commit any wrongdoing relative to competitive practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ratings reflect its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with over $60 billion in 2021 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks have been somewhat mitigated in recent years given <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s rated retail/omnichannel peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. (AA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A/Stable). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with over $570 billion of 2021 (ended January 2022) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage over time. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s 2018 EBITDA of $33 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has significantly greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage around 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> consider its smaller scale at just over $100 billion in 2021 revenue, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins and historically similar leverage profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> compares against cloud service industry peers, including <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corporation</span> (AAA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> (BBB/Negative). From an Infrastructure-as-a-Service perspective, <span class="companylink">AWS</span> has a substantially larger scale (over 30% share globally) than both of these competitors. However, these competitors have significant legacy enterprise products that are able to support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With annual revenue approaching $200 billion, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant position and cash generation from its combination of legacy software products and cloud-based products, with gross leverage below 1.0x and strong cash on balance sheet placing the company in a net cash position. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings -- with over $40 billion in annual revenues -- reflect its solid position in the Enterprise Resource Planning segment that provides substantial cash generation, with elevated gross leverage above 3.0x over the next two to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates annual organic revenue growth for the North American division (primarily ecommerce, 60% and 35% of 2021 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively), which averaged approximately 26% over the past three years, to be 12% in 2022 although moderate to the 6% to 10% range over the next three years given some softening in consumer goods spending and expectations of slower digital channel growth following recently strong years supported by pandemic-related shopping behavior;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America EBITDA margins (prior to allocated lease D&A and stock option expense add-backs), which averaged mid-6% over the past three years, could be modestly positive in 2022 and close to breakeven over the next three years given industry-wide supply chain challenges and general cost inflation; EBITDA could decline toward $7 billion in 2022 from $16 billion and be near breakeven beginning 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth at <span class="companylink">AWS</span> (13% and 61% of 2021 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively), which has averaged about 35% over the past three years, is expected be around 25% annually, in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend in the 35% to 40% range, similar to recent history in the low-40% range, yielding EBITDA expanding toward $50 billion in 2024 from $29 billion in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--International segment (27% and 4% of 2021 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively) revenue growth, which has averaged about 25% over the past three years, is projected to grow around 8% annually longer term. EBITDA is expected to be modestly negative annually given high cost inflation, and in the near term the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on reported results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth in the 10% range, with consolidated revenue expected to reach around $630 billion by 2024 from $470 billion in 2021. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects EBITDA to grow toward $80 billion by 2024 from approximately $62 billion in 2021, as EBITDA margins trend decline from 13% in 2021 to in the low-12% by 2023 on cost inflation, rebounding toward 13% thereafter given faster growth in the higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow before capex, which was $36 billion in 2021, could trend in the mid-$50 billion range in 2022 given EBITDA growth and somewhat less working capital usage (which was close to $20 billion in 2020) and grow thereafter given EBITDA growth and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s assumptions of near-breakeven changes to working capital. FCF, which declined to an outflow of $25 billion in 2021 from an inflow of $17 billion in 2020, could be around negative $10 billion to negative $15 billion in 2022 given better operating cash flow and turn positive in 2024 assuming neutral working capital. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA and FCF calculations are reduced for non-cash finance lease depreciation expense, which was around $10 billion in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which has trended around 2.0x since 2018, is expected to trend in the 2x range beginning in 2022, with EBITDA growth mitigated by debt issuances to fund growth initiatives. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow with which to invest in its business, the company could make temporarily leveraging transactions such as the <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) sustaining under 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating performance that is better than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current expectations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increased confidence in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ability to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly with regard to future growth platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material slowdown in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth trajectory with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained near 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizable investments in new business verticals that limit EBITDA expansion or debt-financed M&A. The outcome of any regulatory activity that would adversely affect <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile would also be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s liquidity as of Sept. 30, 2022 was primarily composed of its reported $47.9 billion in Fitch-defined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of Sept. 30, 2022. The company's short-term investments are reported as marketable securities, consisting of government and agency bonds, 'AAA' rated money market funds, investment-grade fixed-income securities and equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2018, the company initiated a $7 billion CP program, subsequently upsized to $10 billion in June 2020 and to $20 billion in March 2021; the program is backed by its $10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due March 2025 and cash. In November 2022, the company obtained a 364-day, $10 billion unsecured revolver to further bolster liquidity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects CP usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings, but could also support M&A activity or other investments for longer-term growth initiatives. As of Sept. 30, 2022, the company had $11.7 billion of outstanding CP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. is the issuer of all debt, including its unsecured revolver, CP program and approximately $60 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2022. The company has $3.0 billion and $7.25 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2023 and 2024, respectively. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has chosen to enter into finance leases (formerly termed capital leases), generally with three- to five-year terms, for some of its infrastructure, particularly equipment supporting <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, given its low cost of capital and desire to preserve cash for investment optionality. Per <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, the company's finance lease arrangements are capitalized at 4.0x annual operating expenses (including amortization and interest).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Finance lease amortization and interest expense, like operating lease expense, are now considered operating expenses by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> and reduce EBITDA and FCF; these expenses, which were $9.9 billion in 2021, should decline over time as capital leases roll off, and are added back to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDAR calculation and added to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s financing cash flow calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company issued $18.5 billion and $12.75 billion in unsecured notes in May 2021 and April 2022, respectively, and has proposed another unsecured debt issuance in November 2022. A significant portion of proceeds could be used to replace future capital lease arrangements, which mitigates the impact of the issuances on Fitch-defined leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s unsecured debt balance could grow over time to support growth initiatives, although <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> could use FCF to reduce debt as it has on occasion in the past. Alternatively, the company could choose to issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition in 2017. The company began a share repurchase program in 2022 and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes around $5 billion of buybacks annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is a global leader in both e-commerce and cloud compute services, with $470 billion in 2021 revenue and over $60 billion in EBITDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has adjusted the historical debt by adding 8x annual operating lease expense and 4x annual finance lease expense. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also adjusts for stock-based compensation expense, which totaled $12.8 billion in 2021.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-11 April 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'AA-' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>.'s proposed unsecured notes issuance. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital and capex. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s existing ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-' and Short-Term IDR of 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s rating reflects its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with over $60 billion in 2021 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable adjusted leverage expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks have been somewhat mitigated recently given increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Positions from Superior Strategy and Execution: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company's innovations provided customers greater comfort in making online purchases but also forged a path of capabilities that others have strived to emulate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (<span class="companylink">AWS</span>), which grew out of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s internal efforts to service its growing online retail business, has similarly helped to establish the cloud computing industry offerings. The company's success has led to exponential growth in its EBITDA, FCF and cash position. In 2021, the company generated $62 billion of Fitch-defined EBITDA; the company has generated an average of around $8 billion in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> defined FCF over the past four years despite spending over $130 billion in capex during that time. The company ended 2021 with $72 billion of Fitch-defined cash and equivalents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Connections and Suite of Assets Yield Operating Flexibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s leadership position and scale, supported by good strategic foresight and execution, have created a virtuous circle of growth and investment for the company. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength. These attributes provide the company maneuverability to quickly execute changes and an ability to expand its operation in ways not traditionally seen for either retailers or technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets and Verticals: Partly a result of its own path-forging that helped to establish new industry verticals, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is exposed to several high-growth markets including cloud services and e-commerce. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the cloud services market could grow roughly 25% annually in the medium term, while e-commerce growth could be in the low double digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s financial profile has improved in recent years across a number of metrics. Annual revenue has grown at an average of nearly 30% over the past five years, with close to 40% average annual growth in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s high-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business. As a result of revenue growth, EBITDA expanded to $62 billion in 2020 (13.1% of revenue) from $10.6 billion in 2015 (9.9% of revenue).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth in EBITDA has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. For the three years ended 2020, FCF averaged $22 billion (adding back lease depreciation which is in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s FCF calculation) after an average $23 billion spent on capex. FCF on the same basis turned negative in 2021 at around $15 billion given a significant ramp in inventory and capex and could remain negative at around negative $10 billion in 2022 although turn positive in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth to continue at a strong, albeit moderating, pace given the company's scale, with low-teens revenue growth expected annually. Given stronger growth in the company's higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business, annual EBITDA growth could be in the 15% to 20% range, although closer to 10% in 2022 given incremental supply chain expenses. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend in the high-1.0x range, close to where the company has operated for the past three years, following the modestly leveraging acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic Growth Path: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has either made inroads in, or is rumored to be interested in, a number of opportunities both adjacent to its current verticals and somewhat afield of its major business lines. These verticals include logistics, voice recognition applications, smart home capabilities, healthcare services, media and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While the company has a proven track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has also made outsized growth investments. The company has shown comfort in and propensity to make large investments in areas that could be significantly margin dilutive with a longer-term investment time horizon. Recent examples include the $13.7 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> in 2017 and the $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios (<span class="companylink">MGM Holdings Inc</span>.) in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to look toward new avenues of growth, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s primary source of cash flow and earnings is expected to remain its existing e-commerce and <span class="companylink">AWS</span> businesses, for the foreseeable future. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has ample ability to invest in its business through internally generated cash flow, although the rating case incorporates room for the company to make outsized investments or acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Political discussion around Big Tech has prompted speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>. Outcomes of inquiries in the U.S. and the <span class="companylink">EU</span> could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which, in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s case, could include a breakup of the company. Fines or other penalties could be levied if the company was found to commit any wrongdoing relative to competitive practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ratings reflect its leading positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with over $60 billion in 2021 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks have been somewhat mitigated in recent years given <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s rated retail/omnichannel peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. (AA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A/Stable). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with over $570 billion of 2021 (ended January 2022) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage over time. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s 2018 EBITDA of $33 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has significantly greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage around 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> consider its smaller scale at just over $100 billion in 2021 revenue, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins and historically similar leverage profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> compares against cloud service industry peers, including <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corporation</span> (AAA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> (BBB+/Negative Watch). From an Infrastructure-as-a-Service perspective, <span class="companylink">AWS</span> has a substantially larger scale (approximately 33% share globally) than both of these competitors. However, these competitors have significant legacy enterprise products that are able to support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With annual revenue over $140 billion, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant position and cash generation from its combination of legacy software products and cloud-based products, with gross leverage below 1.0x and strong cash on balance sheet placing the company in a net cash position. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings -- with approximately $40 billion in annual revenues -- reflect its solid position in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) segment that provides substantial cash generation, with elevated gross leverage above 3.0x over the next two to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates annual organic revenue growth for the North American ecommerce division (60% and 35% of 2021 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively), which averaged approximately 26% over the past three years, to be at least 10% longer term, as <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> should at least hold market share in an e-commerce retail channel, which is expected to grow 10% to 15%. Revenue in 2022 could be modestly below this range, given recently strong results and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations that digital growth could slow somewhat in 2022 as customers return to physical stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America EBITDA margins (prior to allocated lease D&A and stock option expense add-backs), which averaged mid-6% over the past three years, could moderate to the 4% range in 2022 given industry-wide supply chain challenges and wage inflation; EBITDA could decline toward $12 billion from $16 billion in 2021. EBITDA margins could improve toward 5% thereafter with EBITDA expanding toward $18 billion by 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth at <span class="companylink">AWS</span> (13% and 61% of 2021 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively), which has averaged about 35% over the past three years, is expected be around 25% annually, in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend in the 35% to 40% range, similar to recent history in the low-40% range, yielding EBITDA expanding toward $49 billion in 2024 from $29 billion in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--International segment (27% and 4% of 2021 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively) revenue growth, which has averaged about 25% over the past three years, is projected to grow around 8% annually longer term. EBITDA is expected to be breakeven to modestly positive annually as the business has operated close to break-even EBITDA in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth of about 11% in 2022 and the 12% range beginning 2023, with consolidated revenue expected to reach mid-$600 billion by 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects EBITDA to grow toward $100 billion by 2024 from approximately $62 billion in 2021, as EBITDA margins improve from 13% in 2021 toward 15% by 2024, largely on faster top-line growth in the higher-margin <span class="companylink">AWS</span> business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow before capex, which was $36 billion in 2021, could trend in the mid-$50 billion range in 2022 given EBITDA growth and less working capital usage (which was close to $20 billion in 2020) and generally grow alongside EBITDA thereafter. FCF, which declined to an outflow of $25 billion in 2021 from an inflow of $17 billion in 2020, could be around negative $15 billion in 2022 assuming higher capex levels, but turn breakeven in 2023 and positive in 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA and FCF calculations are reduced for non-cash finance lease depreciation expense, which was around $10 billion in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which had declined from a recent peak 2.5x in 2017 following the debt-financed acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span>, declined to approximately 2.0x in 2021 on EBITDA growth. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend in the high-1x to 2x range beginning in 2022 on EBITDA growth, depending on <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s capex funding decisions. While <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow with which to invest in its business, the company could make temporarily leveraging transactions such as the <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) sustaining under 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating performance that is better than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current expectations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increased confidence in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s ability to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly with regard to future growth platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material slowdown in <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s growth trajectory with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained near 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizable investments in new business verticals that limit EBITDA expansion or debt-financed M&A. The outcome of any regulatory activity that would adversely affect <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s credit profile would also be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> reported $72.4 billion in Fitch-defined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of Dec. 31, 2021. Total Fitch-calculated liquidity as of December 2021 was around $82 billion supported by cash, $9.3 billion of availability on its undrawn $7 billion (subsequently upsized to $10 billion) unsecured revolver, whose availability was reduced by $725 million of outstanding CP, and approximately $200 million in availability under the company's $1 billion revolver due October 2022, which is secured by seller receivables. The company's short-term investments are reported as marketable securities, consisting of government and agency bonds, 'AAA' rated money market funds, investment-grade fixed-income securities and equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2018, the company initiated a $7 billion CP program, subsequently upsized to $10 billion in June 2020 and to $20 billion in March 2021; the program is backed by its $10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due March 2025 and cash. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects CP usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings, but could also support M&A activity or other investments for longer-term growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. is the issuer of all debt, including its unsecured revolver, CP program and approximately $50 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2021. The company has $1.25 billion and $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2022 and 2023, respectively. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As part of its actions, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed the existing ratings for <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s CP and unsecured notes at 'F1+' and 'AA-', respectively.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> has chosen to enter into finance leases (formerly termed capital leases), generally with three- to five-year terms, for some of its infrastructure, particularly equipment supporting <span class="companylink">AWS</span>, given its low cost of capital and desire to preserve cash for investment optionality. Per <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, the company's finance lease arrangements are capitalized at 4.0x annual operating expenses (including amortization and interest). Finance lease amortization and interest expense, like operating lease expense, are now considered operating expenses by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> and reduce EBITDA and FCF; these expenses, which were $9.9 billion in 2021, should decline over time as capital leases roll off, and are added back to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDAR calculation and added to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s financing cash flow calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company issued $18.5 billion in unsecured notes in May 2021 and has proposed another unsecured debt issuance in April 2022. A significant portion of proceeds could be used to replace future capital lease arrangements, which mitigates the impact of the issuances on Fitch-defined leverage. Proceeds from these issuances could also be used to support <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s recent $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s unsecured debt balance could grow over time to support growth initiatives, although <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> could use FCF to reduce debt as it has on occasion in the past. Alternatively, the company could choose to issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> acquisition in 2017. The company has also begun a share repurchase program in 2022 and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes around $5 billion of buybacks annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> is a global leader in both e-commerce and cloud compute services, with $470 billion in 2021 revenue and over $60 billion in EBITDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has adjusted the historical debt by adding 8x annual operating lease expense and 4x annual finance lease expense. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also adjusts for stock-based compensation expense, which totaled $12.8 billion in 2021.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-07 June 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'AA-' from 'A+'. Fitch has also affirmed its Short-Term IDR and commercial paper program at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The upgrade reflects Amazon's strengthening positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with nearly $50 billion in 2020 EBITDA, strong FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to Amazon's credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks have been somewhat mitigated in recent years given Amazon's increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Positions from Superior Strategy and Execution: Amazon's strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company's innovations provided customers greater comfort in making online purchases but also forged a path of capabilities that others have strived to emulate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (AWS), which grew out of Amazon's internal efforts to service its growing online retail business, has similarly helped to establish the cloud computing industry offerings. The company's success has led to exponential growth in its EBITDA, FCF and cash position. In 2020, the company generated $48 billion of Fitch-defined EBITDA, and $17 billion of FCF after $40 billion (or 10% of sales) of capex. The company ended 2020 with $72 billion of Fitch-defined cash and equivalents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Connections and Suite of Assets Yield Operating Flexibility: Fitch believes Amazon's leadership position and scale, supported by good strategic foresight and execution, have created a virtuous circle of growth and investment for the company. Amazon's customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength. These attributes provide the company maneuverability to quickly execute changes and an ability to expand its operation in ways not traditionally seen for either retailers or technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets and Verticals: Partly a result of its own path-forging that helped to establish new industry verticals, Amazon is exposed to several high-growth markets including cloud services and e-commerce. Fitch estimates the cloud services market could grow roughly 25% annually in the medium term, while e-commerce growth could be in the low double digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile: Amazon's financial profile has improved in recent years across a number of metrics. Annual revenue has grown at an average of nearly 30% over the past five years, with over 40% average annual growth in Amazon's high-margin AWS business. As a result of revenue growth, EBITDA expanded to $48.2 billion in 2020 (12.5% of revenue) from $10.6 billion in 2015 (9.9% of revenue). Growth in EBITDA has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. In 2020, for example, Amazon generated $17 billion in FCF after spending $40 billion on capex. The company has not historically paid a dividend or executed share repurchases since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects Amazon's growth to continue at a strong, albeit moderating, pace given the company's scale, with about 10% to 15% revenue growth expected annually. Given stronger growth in the company's higher-margin AWS business, annual EBITDA growth could be in the 15% to 20% range. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend in the high-1.0x range, close to where the company has operated for the past three years, following the modestly leveraging acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic Growth Path: Amazon has either made inroads in, or is rumored to be interested in, a number of opportunities both adjacent to its current verticals and somewhat afield of its major business lines. These verticals include logistics, voice recognition applications, smart home capabilities, healthcare services, media and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While the company has a proven track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, Amazon has also made outsized growth investments. The company has shown comfort in and propensity to make large investments in areas that could be significantly margin dilutive with a longer-term investment time horizon. Recent examples include the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 and the proposed $8.45 billion acquisition of MGM Studios (<span class="companylink">MGM Holdings Inc</span>.) in May 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch expects the company to look toward new avenues of growth, Amazon's primary source of cash flow and earnings is expected to remain its existing e-commerce and AWS businesses, for the foreseeable future. Fitch believes Amazon has ample ability to invest in its business through internally generated cash flow, although the rating case incorporates room for the company to make outsized investments or acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Political discussion around Big Tech has prompted speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like Amazon. Outcomes of inquiries in the U.S. and the EU could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which, in Amazon's case, could include a breakup of the company. Fines or other penalties could be levied if the company was found to commit any wrongdoing relative to competitive practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The upgrade to Amazon's ratings reflects its strengthening positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with nearly $50 billion in 2020 EBITDA, strong FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) expected to trend near 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to Amazon's credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices, though these risks have been somewhat mitigated in recent years given Amazon's increased financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's rated retail and e-commerce peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. (AA/Stable), <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A/Stable) and <span class="companylink">eBay, Inc</span>. (BBB/Positive). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $559 billion of 2020 (ended January 2021) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage over time. While Amazon's 2019 EBITDA of $43 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has significantly greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage of about 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to Amazon consider its smaller scale, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins and historically similar leverage profile. <span class="companylink">eBay</span>'s ratings reflect its revenue scale of over $10 billion and GMV of approximately $100 billion. Its gross leverage is expected to remain at approximately 2.0x-2.5x through the forecast period, on the low end of rating sensitivities Fitch had previously set for the company's 'BBB' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For AWS, Fitch compares against cloud service industry peers, including <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corporation</span> (AAA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> (BBB+/Negative). From an Infrastructure-as-a-Service perspective, AWS has a substantially larger scale (approximately 33% share globally) than both of these competitors. However, these competitors have significant legacy enterprise products that are able to support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With annual revenue over $140 billion, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant position and cash generation from its combination of legacy software products and cloud-based products, with gross leverage below 1.0x and strong cash on balance sheet placing the company in a net cash position. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings -- with approximately $40 billion in annual revenues -- reflect its solid position in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) segment that provides substantial cash generation, with elevated gross leverage above 3.0x over the next two to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America (61% and 39% of 2020 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Fitch anticipates annual organic revenue growth, which accelerated to 38% in 2020 from around 20% to 25% the prior four years on consumer behavior changes related to the pandemic, to be at least 10% longer term, as Fitch projects Amazon should at least hold market share in an e-commerce retail channel, which is expected to grow 10% to 15%. Revenue in 2021 could be in this range, given strong 40% growth in 1Q21, even assuming deceleration through the year against challenging top-line comparisons from 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America EBITDA margins, which moderated to 6.4% in 2020 from 7.1% in 2019, despite strong revenue growth on heightened operating expenses related to the coronavirus, could remain near 2020 levels as some increased 2020 expenses could become permanent in Amazon's cost structure. As such, EBITDA is expected to grow at low double digits annually from $15 billion in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--AWS (12% and 54% of 2020 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Revenue growth, which has averaged about 40% over the past four years, is expected to trend around 30% in 2021 (32% in 1Q21) and moderate toward 25% beginning in 2022, in line with Fitch's forecast for cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend in the 40% to 50% range, similar to recent history, yielding EBITDA expanding toward $39 billion in 2022 from $21 billion in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--International (27% and 7% of 2020 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Segment revenue growth, which has averaged about 25% over the past four years, is projected to grow around 8% annually longer term, with growth closer to 20% in 2021, given 60% growth in 1Q21. EBITDA is expected to be roughly $1 billion annually as the business has operated close to break-even EBITDA in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth of about 17% in 2021 and the 10% to 12% range beginning 2022, with consolidated revenue expected to reach mid-$500 billion by 2023. Fitch projects EBITDA to grow toward $80 billion by 2023 from approximately $48 billion in 2020, as EBITDA margins improve from 12.5% in 2020 toward 15% by 2023, largely on faster top-line growth in the higher-margin AWS business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow before capex, which was $58 billion in 2020, could trend in the low-$50 billion range in 2021 assuming neutral working capital but grow alongside EBITDA thereafter. FCF, which was $17 billion in 2020, could average around $8 billion beginning in 2021, assuming capex intensity of 10.5% to 11.0%, compared with 10.5% in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8.0x), which had declined from a recent peak of 3.0x in 2014 to 1.7x in 2016, rose to 2.5x in 2017 following the debt-financed acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon finished 2020 with adjusted leverage at 2.0x. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend in the high-1x to 2x range beginning in 2021 on EBITDA growth, depending on Amazon's capex funding decisions. While Amazon is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow with which to invest in its business, the company could make temporarily leveraging transactions such as the Whole Foods acquisition. Amazon could also use FCF to reduce debt as it did as recently as 2015, although this is not factored into Fitch's base case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch has not factored into its model any additional financing to support its proposed $8.45 billion acquisition of MGM Studios, which would add around $300 million in annual EBITDA per MGM's 2020 annual report. Any incremental financing would have a limited impact on Amazon's leverage metrics given Fitch's projection of 2021 adjusted debt (including leases capitalized per Fitch criteria) at around $140 billion following the May 2021 issuance of $18.5 billion of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) sustaining under 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating performance that is better than Fitch's current expectations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increased confidence in Amazon's ability to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly with regard to future growth platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material slowdown in Amazon's growth trajectory with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained near 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizable investments in new business verticals that limit EBITDA expansion or debt-financed M&A. The outcome of any regulatory activity that would adversely impact Amazon's credit profile would also be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: Amazon reported approximately $63 billion, in Fitch-defined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2021. Total liquidity of $69 billion includes approximately $6.3 billion in availability from its undrawn $7 billion unsecured revolver due June 2023, whose availability is reduced by $725 million of outstanding CP, and approximately $300 million in availability from Amazon's $740 million revolver due October 2022, which is secured by seller receivables. The company's short-term investments are reported as market securities, consisting of government and agency bonds, 'AAA' rated money market funds, investment-grade fixed-income securities and equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2018, the company initiated a $7 billion CP program, subsequently upsized to $10 billion in June 2020; the program is backed by its $7 billion unsecured revolver and cash on hand. Fitch expects CP usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings, but could also support M&A activity or other investments for longer-term growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. is the issuer of all debt, including its unsecured revolver, CP program and approximately $32 billion of senior unsecured notes as of March 31, 2021. The company has $1 billion to $2 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing in each of the next three years. Fitch expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has chosen to enter into finance leases (formerly termed capital leases), generally with three- to five-year terms, for some of its infrastructure, particularly equipment supporting AWS, given its low cost of capital and desire to preserve cash for investment optionality. Per Fitch's criteria, the company's finance lease arrangements are capitalized at 4.0x annual operating expenses (including amortization and interest). Finance lease amortization and interest expense, like operating lease expense, are now considered operating expenses by Fitch and are deducted from EBITDA and FCF; these expenses, which were $8.5 billion in 2020, decline over time as capital leases roll off, and would be added back in Fitch's EBITDAR calculation and added to Fitch's financing cash flow calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company issued $18.5 billion in unsecured notes in May 2021, which Fitch expects will be used to replace future capital lease arrangements. As such, the issuance is expected to be leverage neutral over time as existing finance leases roll off and are not replaced. Funds raised could also be used to complete the company's recently proposed acquisition of MGM Studios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's unsecured debt balance could grow over time to support growth initiatives, although Amazon could use FCF to reduce debt as it has on occasion in the past. Alternatively, the company could choose to issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed Whole Foods acquisition in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon is a global leader in both e-commerce and cloud compute services, with over $400 billion in trailing twelve-month (March 2021) revenue and $56 billion in EBITDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has adjusted the historical and projected debt by adding 8x yearly operating lease expense. Fitch has also adjusted projected debt by adding 4x yearly finance lease expense. Fitch adjusts for stock-based compensation expense, which totaled $9.2 billion in 2020.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-10 May 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned an 'A+' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>.'s (Amazon) proposed unsecured note issuance (final amount and maturity to be determined). Fitch expects proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including funding recently increased capex levels as the company purchases equipment previously funded through capital lease arrangements. The issuance is expected to be leverage-neutral, with minimal impact on Amazon's credit profile under Fitch's growth assumptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's 'A+' rating and Positive Rating Outlook reflect its leading and strengthening positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale, strong FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted leverage at 2.0x in 2020. The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution, and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. Risks to Amazon's credit profile include some uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's scale and business practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Positions from Superior Strategy and Execution</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing. The company's innovations provided customers greater comfort in making online purchases but also forged a path of capabilities that others have strived to emulate. <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (AWS), which grew out of Amazon's internal efforts to service its growing online retail business, has similarly helped to establish the cloud computing industry offerings. The company's success has led to exponential growth in its EBITDA, FCF and cash position. In 2020, the company generated $48 billion of Fitch-defined EBITDA, and $17 billion of FCF after $40 billion (or 10% of sales) of capex. The company ended 2020 with $72 billion of Fitch-defined cash and equivalents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Connections and Suite of Assets Yield Operating Flexibility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Amazon's leadership position and scale, supported by good strategic foresight and execution, have created a virtuous circle of growth and investment for the company. Amazon's customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength. These attributes provide the company maneuverability to quickly execute changes and an ability to expand its operation in ways not traditionally seen for either retailers or technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets and Verticals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Partly a result of its own path-forging that helped to establish new industry verticals, Amazon is exposed to several high-growth markets including cloud services and e-commerce. Fitch estimates the cloud services market could grow roughly 25% annually in the medium term, while e-commerce growth could be in the low double digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's financial profile has improved in recent years across a number of metrics. Annual revenue has grown at an average of nearly 30% over the past five years, with over 40% average annual growth in Amazon's high-margin AWS business. As a result of revenue growth, EBITDA expanded to $48.2 billion in 2020 (12.5% of revenue) from $10.6 billion in 2015 (9.9% of revenue). Growth in EBITDA has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. In 2020, for example, Amazon generated $17 billion in FCF after spending $40 billion on capex. The company has not historically paid a dividend or executed share repurchases since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects Amazon's growth to continue at a strong, albeit moderating, pace given the company's scale, with about 10% to 15% revenue growth expected annually. Given stronger growth in the company's higher-margin AWS business, annual EBITDA growth could be in the 15% to 20% range. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend in the high-1.0x range, close to where the company has operated for the past three years, following the modestly leveraging acquisition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic Growth Path Yields Uncertainty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While the company has a proven track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, Amazon has also made outsized growth investments. The company has shown comfort in and propensity to make large investments in areas that could be significantly margin dilutive with a longer-term investment time horizon. While Fitch expects the company to look toward new avenues of growth, Amazon's primary source of cash flow and earnings is expected to remain its existing e-commerce and AWS businesses, for the foreseeable future. Fitch believes Amazon has ample ability to invest in its business through internally generated cash flow, although the rating case incorporates room for the company to make outsized investments or acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Political discussion around Big Tech has prompted speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like Amazon. Outcomes of inquiries in the U.S. and the EU could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which, in Amazon's case, could include a breakup of the company. Fines or other penalties could be levied if the company was found to commit any wrongdoing relative to competitive practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >New Business Opportunities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has either made inroads in, or is rumored to be interested in, a number of opportunities both adjacent to its current verticals and somewhat afield of its major business lines. These verticals include logistics, voice recognition applications, smart home capabilities, healthcare services, media and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's 'A+' Long-Term IDR reflects its strong positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale, strong FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8.0x) at 2.0x in 2019. The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution, and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Positive Rating Outlook reflects the company's strengthening operating and financial profile, including better than expected revenue, EBITDA and cash flow over the past several years, and increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR remaining below 2.0x over time. Understanding the scope and impact around the recent regulatory activity and more clarity regarding the company's evolving business model and longer-term ambitions - particularly with regard to future growth platforms - would provide Fitch increased confidence in Amazon maintaining its existing credit profile over time, which could lead to a positive rating action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's rated retail and e-commerce peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. (AA/Stable Rating Outlook), <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A-/Stable Rating Outlook) and <span class="companylink">eBay, Inc</span>. (BBB/Positive Rating Outlook). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $559 billion of 2020 (ended January 2021) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage over time. While Amazon's 2019 EBITDA of $43 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has significantly greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage of about 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to Amazon consider its smaller scale, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins and historically similar leverage profile. <span class="companylink">eBay</span>'s ratings reflect its revenue scale of over $10 billion and GMV of approximately $85 billion in the e-commerce segment that competes against Amazon's third-party seller platform. Its gross leverage is expected to remain at approximately 2x-2.5x through our forecast period, on the low end of rating sensitivities Fitch had previously set for the company's 'BBB' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For AWS, Fitch compares against cloud service industry peers, including <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corporation</span> (AAA/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Oracle Corporation</span> (BBB+/Negative). From an IaaS perspective, AWS has a substantially larger scale (approximately 50% share) than both of these competitors. However, these competitors have significant legacy enterprise products that are able to support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With annual revenue approaching $140 billion, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant position and cash generation from its combination of legacy software products and cloud-based products, with gross leverage approaching 1.0x and strong cash on balance sheet placing the company in a net cash position. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings - with $40 billion in annual revenues - reflect its solid position in the ERP segment that provides substantial cash generation, with elevated gross leverage at over 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America (61% and 39% of 2020 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Fitch anticipates annual organic revenue growth, which accelerated to 38% in 2020 from around 20% to 25% the prior four years on consumer behavior changes related to the pandemic, to be at least 10% longer term, as Fitch projects Amazon should at least hold market share in an e-commerce retail channel, which is expected to grow 10% to 15%. Revenue in 2021 could be in this range, given strong 40% growth in 1Q21, even assuming deceleration through the year against challenging top-line comparisons from 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >North America EBITDA margins, which moderated to 6.4% in 2020 from 7.1% in 2019, despite strong revenue growth on heightened operating expenses related to the coronavirus, could remain near 2020 levels as some increased 2020 expenses could become permanent in Amazon's cost structure. As such, EBITDA is expected to grow at low double digits annually from $15 billion in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--AWS (12% and 54% of 2020 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Revenue growth, which has averaged about 40% over the past four years, is expected to trend around 30% in 2021 (32% in 1Q21) and moderate toward 25% beginning in 2022, in line with Fitch's forecast for cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend in the 40% to 50% range, similar to recent history, yielding EBITDA expanding toward $39 billion in 2022 from $21 billion in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--International (27% and 7% of 2020 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Segment revenue growth, which has averaged about 25% over the past four years, is projected to grow around 8% annually longer term, with growth closer to 20% in 2021, given 60% growth in 1Q21. EBITDA is expected to be roughly $1 billion annually as the business has operated close to break-even EBITDA in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth of about 17% in 2021 and the 10% to 12% range beginning 2022, with consolidated revenue expected to reach mid-$500 billion by 2023. Fitch projects EBITDA to grow toward $80 billion by 2023 from approximately $48 billion in 2020, as EBITDA margins improve from 12.5% in 2020 toward 15% by 2023, largely on faster top-line growth in the higher-margin AWS business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow before capex, which was $58 billion in 2020, could trend in the low-$50 billion range in 2021 assuming neutral working capital but grow alongside EBITDA thereafter. FCF, which was $17 billion in 2020, could average around $8 billion beginning in 2021, assuming capex intensity of 10.5% to 11%, compared with 10.5% in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8.0x), which had declined from a recent peak of 3.0x in 2014 to 1.7x in 2016, rose to 2.5x in 2017 following the debt-financed acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon finished 2020 with adjusted leverage at 2.0x. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend in the high-1x to 2x range beginning in 2021 on EBITDA growth, depending on Amazon's capex funding decisions. While Amazon is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow with which to invest in its business, the company could make temporarily leveraging transactions such as the Whole Foods acquisition. Amazon could also use FCF to reduce debt as it did as recently as 2015, although this is not factored into Fitch's base case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--To upgrade Amazon to the 'AA' category, Fitch would need increased confidence in Amazon's ability to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity. Fitch would also need greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly with regard to future growth platforms, to consider an upgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--In addition to the above, Amazon would need to provide a publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) sustaining under 2.0x, combined with operating performance that is in line with Fitch's current expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material slowdown in Amazon's growth trajectory with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizable investments in new business verticals that limit EBITDA expansion or debt-financed M&A. The outcome of any regulatory activity that would adversely impact Amazon's credit profile would also be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: Amazon reported approximately $63 billion in Fitch-defined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2021. Total liquidity of $69 billion includes approximately $6.3 billion in availability from its undrawn $7 billion unsecured revolver due June 2023, whose availability is reduced by $725 million of outstanding CP, and approximately $300 million in availability from Amazon's $740 million revolver due October 2022, which is secured by seller receivables. The company's short-term investments are reported as market securities, consisting of government and agency bonds, 'AAA' rated money market funds and investment-grade fixed-income securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2018, the company initiated a $7 billion CP program, subsequently upsized to $10 billion in June 2020; the program is backed by its $7 billion unsecured revolver and cash on hand. Fitch expects CP usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings but could also support M&A activity or other investments for longer-term growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. is the issuer of all debt, including its unsecured revolver, CP program and approximately $32 billion of senior unsecured notes as of March 31, 2021. The company has $1 billion to $2 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing in each of the next three years. Fitch expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has chosen to enter into finance leases (formerly termed capital leases), generally with three to five year terms, for some of its infrastructure, particularly facilities supporting AWS, given its low cost of capital and desire to preserve cash for investment optionality. Per Fitch's criteria, the company's finance lease arrangements are capitalized at 4.0x annual operating expenses (including amortization and interest). Finance lease amortization and interest expense, like operating lease expense, are now considered operating expenses by Fitch and are deducted from EBITDA and FCF; these expenses, which were $8.5 billion in 2020, decline over time as capital leases roll off, and would be added back in Fitch's EBITDAR calculation and added to Fitch's financing cash flow calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has proposed the issuance of $15 billion in unsecured notes, which Fitch expects would be used to replace future capital lease arrangements. As such, the issuance is expected to be leverage neutral over time as existing finance leases roll off and are not replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's unsecured debt balance could grow over time to support growth initiatives, although Amazon could use FCF to reduce debt as it has on occasion in the past. Alternatively, the company could choose to issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed Whole Foods acquisition in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Fitch has adjusted the historical and projected debt by adding 8x yearly operating lease expense. Fitch has also adjusted projected debt by adding 4x yearly finance lease expense. Fitch adjusts for stock based compensation expense, which totaled $9.2 billion for YE20.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Sydney/Mumbai-16 April 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed Indian retailer <span class="companylink">Future Retail Limited</span>'s (FRL) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'C' and the rating on its USD500 million 5.6% senior secured notes due 2025 at 'C' while revising the Recovery Rating to 'RR5' from 'RR4'. Fitch has removed the Rating Watch Positive (RWP), which had been placed on both ratings on 2 September 2020 after FRL's announcement it was selling its business to Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Limited (RRFLL), an indirect subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Reliance Industries Ltd</span> (RIL; BBB-/Stable).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The removal of the RWP underscores the significant delay in completing the sale, contrary to our previous expectations, after a legal challenge to the deal by an entity controlled by <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. (A+/Positive), which indirectly holds 4.8% of FRL. FRL may also face more challenges in securing the required shareholder and creditor approvals for the sale. This is because the founding Biyani family's stake in FRL has been reduced following lenders' invocation of pledges on FRL shares. FRL and other Future Group entities that are part of the sale are negotiating with the lenders under the <span class="companylink">Indian central bank</span>'s August 2020 One Time Restructuring (OTR) framework that was introduced to help companies during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The sale will be credit positive if completed successfully, although it no longer remains the immediate rating driver due to the uncertainty over the timing of its completion and the potential downward rating implications from the debt-restructuring process in the very near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The revision in the US dollar notes' Recovery Rating reflects the lowering of our recovery estimates after including in the waterfall analysis unpaid interest and accrued liabilities on onshore obligations from March 2020, when FRL opted for a debt-servicing moratorium, allowed by the <span class="companylink">Indian central bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FRL's IDR of 'C 'reflects its continued financial stress amid the prolonged impact of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in its higher margin non-food business that faces more restrictions due to its classification as a non-essential category. The second wave of the virus in India could further delay the recovery in FRL's cash flows during the financial year ending March 2022 (FY22) if the curbs are imposed more widely in the country. Failure to secure lenders' approval for the OTR scheme or a triggering of a change-of-control event on its US dollar bonds will also cause immediate liquidity pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OTR Implications: Invoking the OTR process in October 2020 enabled FRL's onshore lenders, which account for the majority of its outstanding debt, to treat the loans as current despite payment delays. Failure to implement the OTR by 26 April 2021 will lead to a conventional default if FRL fails to service the debt subsequently in line with the terms. If the lenders agree on the OTR within the deadline, Fitch will evaluate the final terms to assess if they amount to a distressed debt exchange (DDE). Fitch understands that FRL is in talks with onshore lenders to implement the OTR before the deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sale Completion Positive for Credit: Fitch had earlier expected the deal to be completed by March 2021. RIL remains keen to pursue the deal, notwithstanding the litigation-related delays, as reflected in its decision to extend the long-stop date for the completion to September 2021 from March 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FRL will cease to exist after the deal is completed, but its credit profile could benefit in the meantime if its access to credit improves after the deal announcement. The bond rating will depend on which RIL entity assumes the debt, including any potential enhancements and a review of the ties with RIL under Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage Rating Criteria. Nevertheless, we expect RIL's better credit profile to be reflected in the bonds' rating, if the deal is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Change-of-Control Risks: The stake of "permitted" shareholders according to the bond documentation - mainly the Biyani family and Amazon - fell to 20.5% by 31 March 2021 from 47% at end-2019 after the lenders at FRL's main shareholder, Future Corporate Resources Pvt Ltd (FCRPL), invoked the share pledges. Their stake is below the 26% threshold that could trigger repurchase on the US dollar notes under a change-of-control clause defined in their indenture, if accompanied by a rating downgrade of at least one notch subsequently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG - Management Strategy: FRL has an ESG Relevance Score of '5' for Management Strategy. We believe management faces multiple challenges in the current environment, notwithstanding a broadly consistent execution record backed by adequate industry experience. The pandemic had a severe impact on its financial flexibility, leading to the OTR negotiations with lenders. Ongoing litigation and delays around the sale to RIL pose significant impediments to management's strategy to improve financial flexibility in the current environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG - Governance: FRL has an ESG Relevance Score of '5' for Governance Structure. The Biyani family has pursued growth investment at its operating companies rather than limiting leverage and preserving balance-sheet flexibility at the holding company. This is evident from FCRPL's constrained financial flexibility, which led to the share pledge invocation and the significant stake reduction. The reduced stake will create additional hurdles in securing shareholder approval for the sale to RIL and exposes FRL to excessive liquidity risk if the change-of-control clause is triggered on the US dollar notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We believe the restrictions in the bond documentation limit the risk of cash leakage to its shareholders. Nonetheless, a default of its shareholders may cause significant reputational damage and constrain FRL's ability to secure additional working capital to mitigate its liquidity pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FRL's IDR 'C' is driven by its poor liquidity and further risks from the ongoing debt restructuring negotiations with lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Sales to drop by 71% in FY21 due to pandemic-related curbs in 2020. Sales in FY22 to remain about 30% lower than FY20 as the virus' resurgence after March 2021 will slow the normalisation of its business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- EBITDA margin to turn negative 17% in FY21 (FY20: 2.8%) on weak sales, which counterbalanced cost-saving initiatives implemented during the pandemic. EBITDA margin to improve to 2.3% in FY22 on the back of normalising sales, particularly from the more profitable non-food segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Annual capex as percentage of sales to remain at around 3% in FY21 and FY22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- No dividends in FY21 and FY22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Fitch's recovery analysis assumes that FRL would be considered a going-concern in bankruptcy and the company would be reorganised rather than liquidated. We have assumed a 10% administrative claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The going-concern value is based on a going-concern EBITDA of INR5 billion and a 5x multiple. The EBITDA assumes a right-sizing of the business such that interest, operating expenditure and maintenance capex are covered. The 5.0x multiple is towards the higher end of the 5.4x median multiple for retail going-concern reorganisations to reflect FRL's leading market position in India. It is lower than the around 7x level at which FRL was trading on 31 March 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- We used FRL's debt as of 29 October 2020 after including accrued liabilities. Secured working capital and secured US dollar notes account for the majority of FRL's debt. We assume that FRL's available but undrawn lines will be fully drawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-The recovery waterfall results in a recovery-rate estimate corresponding to a 'RR5' Recovery Rating for the USD500 million secured notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- An upgrade is unlikely given FRL's financial stress and the debt restructuring negotiations with lenders. However, an improvement in FRL's liquidity position could result in positive rating action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Fitch will downgrade FRL's Long-Term IDR to 'RD' (Restricted Default) if, in our review, the final agreed terms of the OTR amount to a DDE. We will thereafter reassess the company's IDR based on its post-OTR capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- FRL defaulting on its debt obligations or entering into a formal winding-up procedure, such as bankruptcy or administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Severely Constrained Liquidity: Sustained operating losses, even after 1QFY21 when the coronavirus-related curbs in India were gradually relaxed, have severely impaired FRL's liquidity and debt-servicing ability. FRL managed to pay the coupon on the US dollar notes but only after the scheduled date and it had to opt for the debt-restructuring plan with its onshore lenders. FRL's ability to obtain new bank lines has been constrained amid the discussions with its lenders to restructure existing debt. We believe FRL's liquidity will face additional setbacks in the absence of the sale transaction with RIL.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FRL has an ESG Relevance Score of '5' for Management Strategy, which reflects the limitations on management's ability to implement its strategy due to the significant impact of the coronavirus on the business and ongoing litigation delaying the progress on the sale of the business. This has a negative impact on the company's credit profile and is highly relevant to the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FRL has an ESG Relevance Score of '5' for Governance Structure, which reflects the shareholding concentration and presence of highly leveraged related parties. This has a negative impact on the company's credit profile and is highly relevant to the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FRL has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Social Impact, reflecting the risk to its business from a shift by consumers towards online shopping. This has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant in the rating in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FRL has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Financial Transparency, reflecting the limited information provided on liquidity and access to capital. This has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant in the rating in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-17 July 2020: Fitch has affirmed Target's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes at 'A-' as well as its Short-Term IDR and commercial paper program at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings reflect its strong U.S. market position, well-recognized brand name, and modest financial leverage with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8.0x) expected to trend in the low 2.0x range beginning in 2021. Target's leverage is expected to be temporarily elevated in 2020 at around 2.5x due to incremental store expenses due to the pandemic, weak sales of higher-margin products like apparel, and $2.5 billion in proactive debt issuance to support near term liquidity; Fitch expects Target could repay upcoming maturities including $1 billion of notes due January 2022. The ratings consider Target's outsized exposure to categories experiencing a high level of online intrusion and strengthening e-commerce competition from <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. ('A+'/Positive) and <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. ('AA'/Stable). However, Target continues to invest in its omnichannel capabilities, has good product diversification, is reducing prices, and has a strong portfolio of private brands, which help differentiate its merchandise and enhance customer value while providing gross margin mix benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic - Near Term Impact</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The coronavirus pandemic has caused significant changes to both near-term U.S. consumer behavior and Fitch's expectations around U.S. retail sales through the next 12 to 18 months. Since shelter in place activity began in March, staples retailers like Target have seen sales uplift as consumers purchase essential general merchandise items; grocery sales have been particularly strong given restaurant closures. Retailers which have experienced topline uplifts have also seen operating expense growth, due largely to higher employee wages and 'hero' bonuses as well as enhanced cleaning expense. Some retailers, including Target, have also seen expense growth from increased online order penetration, which yields incremental delivery expense or labor in the case of in-store pickup of online orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Relative to other staples retailers, Target's operating trends in recent months have been somewhat weaker due to its higher penetration of high-margin discretionary categories like apparel and home, which have been softer as customers focus attention elsewhere. Fitch expects sales in these discretionary categories to improve in 2021 but remain below 2019 levels on recessionary pressures resulting from high unemployment and other weak macroeconomic factors exiting the shelter- in-place period. Target's outsized exposure to these categories, which are expected to see topline pressure in the near term and ongoing intrusion from the online and deeper-discount channels in the medium term, continues to be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects many of the above trends to persist through 2020, although moderate as restaurants open and grocery strength subsides, and as some near term expenses such as employee bonuses end. Fitch also expects sales in discretionary categories to improve through the balance of 2020 although remain below 2019 levels. In 2020, Fitch expects Target's topline to expand around 5% to approximately $82 billion, although EBITDA is expected to decline around 20% to the $6 billion range from $7.4 billion in 2019 on higher expenses and mix shifts toward lower-margin categories. Revenue in 2021 could moderate slightly toward $80 billion on difficult grocery comparisons, mitigated somewhat by lapping weak trends in discretionary categories. EBITDA is expected to improve toward $7 billion on improved merchandise mix shifts and reduced pandemic-related operating expenses. Revenue and EBITDA are expected to resume low-single digit growth in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >To support near term liquidity, in March 2020 Target issued $2.5 billion in unsecured notes and in April 2020 added a $900 million 364-day unsecured credit facility. As of May 2, Target's liquidity included $4.6 billion in cash and essentially full access to its new credit facility as well as its existing $2.5 billion facility, which matures in 2023. Fitch expects Target to generate over $1 billion in FCF in 2020, after dividends of approximately $1.4 billion, or around $2.68 per share. Target's ample liquidity and good FCF generation should enable the company to continue managing well through the current environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic - Long Term Implication</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects Target to benefit longer term from several implications of the coronavirus pandemic and consumer spending downturn. First, the pandemic has accelerated real estate retrenchment, defaults, and liquidations from weaker players. Stronger players are similarly reconsidering real estate expansion plans and some may pare existing store count. An expected rationalization of retail square footage across a number of categories will improve the retail supply/demand balance, allowing strong competitors like Target to consolidate and grow share over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Second, Fitch expects the pandemic to prove a watershed moment for consumer acceptance of omnichannel models, including store pickup of online orders, particularly in lower-online penetration categories like grocery. Omnichannel winners are those retailers with a good portfolio of physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory. These models are capital intensive to build and typically lower-margin than store operations. This is particularly true within grocery, where distribution expenses and logistical complexity have kept penetration low. As a result, better positioned incumbents like Target with good customer relationships and the ability to invest internally generated cash flow should be able to strengthen their omnichannel models and market share over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Margin Disruption</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's EBITDA margin declined from a peak of 10.6% in 2016 to around 9% in 2018 on reduced retail prices, increased omnichannel investments, and minimum wage raises. These factors caused EBITDA to decline to $6.7 billion in 2018 from $7.4 billion in 2016 despite top-line expansion. EBITDA did improve to $7.4 billion, or 9.5% of revenue, in 2019 as sales grew 4%, benefitting from recent initiatives and good overall retail sales growth. Target's EBITDA trajectory has echoed that of many retail leaders, which have seen above-average growth in investments to support omnichannel strategies. Following an anomalous margin decline in 2020 toward an expected 7% level on mix shifts and pandemic-related expenses, Fitch expects EBITDA margins could settle around 9% beginning 2021 on lingering challenges in higher-margin categories. Margins could remain near 9% into 2022 as an improving discretionary spending environment is mitigated by continued secular shifts toward the more expensive omnichannel business model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Good FCF</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target generates ample cash flow, which allows it the flexibility to invest in growth while deploying capital for both debt reduction and share buybacks in addition to its dividend. Annual FCF (after dividends) during 2015-2017 averaged near $3 billion, though moderated to around $1.1 billion in 2018 given a $1 billion increase in capex to $3.5 billion and lower working capital benefits. In 2019, Target generated $2.8 billion in FCF based on EBITDA growth and a $500 million decline in capex. In 2020, despite a decline in EBITDA, Fitch expects Target will generate FCF in the low- to mid-$1 billion range as the company pulls back certain capital investments. Beginning 2021, Fitch expects FCF to remain in the low- to mid-$1 billion range as EBITDA growth is mitigated by higher capex spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Commitment to Steady Leverage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) has been 1.9x over the past four years despite EBITDA reductions as the company reduced debt by $2.7 billion between 2016 and 2019, in line with the company's public commitment to maintain its existing credit profile. Leverage is expected to be elevated in 2020, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR forecast around 2.5x, on one-time EBITDA declines and debt issuance. Fitch expects adjusted leverage to return to around 2.0x beginning 2021, assuming EBITDA rebounds in line with Fitch's forecast and Target uses cash on hand to repay upcoming maturities, largely its $1 billion of unsecured notes due January 2022. FCF is expected to be used to resume share buybacks, which Target has paused due to the coronavirus pandemic, and strategic initiatives.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings reflect its strong U.S. market position, well-recognized brand name, and modest financial leverage with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) expected to trend in the low 2.0x range beginning in 2021. Target's leverage is expected to be temporarily elevated in 2020 at around 2.5x due to incremental store expenses due to the pandemic, weak sales of higher-margin products like apparel, and $2.5 billion in proactive debt issuance to support near-term liquidity; Fitch expects Target could repay upcoming maturities including $1 billion of notes due January 2022. The ratings consider Target's outsized exposure to categories experiencing a high level of online intrusion and strengthening ecommerce competition from <span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. ('A+'/Positive Outlook) and <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. ('AA'/Stable). However, Target continues to invest in its omnichannel capabilities, has good product diversification, is reducing prices, and has a strong portfolio of private brands, which help differentiate its merchandise and enhance customer value while providing gross margin mix benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading U.S. retailers within Fitch's coverage include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. ('AA'/Stable), <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> ('A+'/Positive Outlook), and <span class="companylink">The Home Depot, Inc</span>. ('A'/Stable). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> is the highest rated of these retailers due to its significant relative scale, cash flow generation, and diversification across product categories and geographies. Its rating also reflects its demonstrated ability to use its scale to produce stable operating and financial performance over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's rating reflects its strong positions in global ecommerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale, strong FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) at 1.7x in 2019. The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. The Positive Outlook reflects the company's strengthening operating and financial profile, including better than expected revenue, EBITDA and cash flow over the past several years and increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR remaining below 2.0x over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Home Depot's rating reflects its market leading position in the home improvement retail space, as well as its large scale with over $100 billion in annual revenue, and its proven adherence to a conservative financial policy (including maintaining adjusted debt/EBITDAR at or below 2.0x) through economic cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Based on Fitch's assessment of Target's financial flexibility, the agency has assigned the higher of the two short-term rating options (F1) for the current rating profile. Any material weakening in financial flexibility, financial structure, or operating environment conditions could lead to the assignment of the lower of the two short-term rating options for the current long-term profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Revenue growth in 2020 is expected to be above-trend at around 5% due to heightened consumer demand for groceries and other non-discretionary goods, somewhat mitigated by declines in discretionary categories like apparel and home. Sales are expected to slightly decline in 2021 following above-average growth in 2020. Starting in 2022, revenue should grow in the low-single digits reflecting positive comps and very modest store expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Fitch projects EBITDA to decline from $7.4 billion in 2019 to $5.9 billion in 2020 as topline growth is offset by incremental operating expenses during the pandemic, including wages and omnichannel costs, as well as revenue declines in high-margin discretionary categories. EBITDA margins are expected to decline to the low 7% range in 2020 from 9.5% in 2019 before rebounding toward 9% in 2021 as operating fundamentals normalize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- FCF is expected to trend in the low-to-mid $1 billion range for the next two to three years, below the $2.3 billion average over the past three years, reflecting EBITDA declines in 2020 and Fitch's assumption of neutral working capital, which has benefited cash flow in recent years. Fitch expects FCF could be used toward share repurchases and strategic investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) is expected to climb to the mid-2x range in 2020 on EBITDA declines and Target's $2.5 billion unsecured note issuance to support liquidity. Adjusted leverage could return toward 2x in 2021, assuming an EBITDA rebound and the repayment of upcoming maturities, including $1 billion due January 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could individually or collectively lead to an upgrade to 'A' include consistently strong operating momentum, represented by sustained comparable sales (comps) of approximately 2% or more, and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) sustained under 2.0x. Fitch would also need greater comfort in Target's success in reducing its premium price perception relative to other discounters and greater confidence in its ability to maintain competitive positioning in disrupted categories like home and apparel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could individually or collectively lead to a negative rating action include consistently negative comps, which drive EBITDA toward the mid-$5 billion range and consequently total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) nearing the mid-2.0x range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ample Liquidity: As of May 2, 2020, Target had cash of $4.6 billion, an undrawn $900 million unsecured credit facility maturing April 2021 and an undrawn $2.5 billion unsecured credit facility maturing October 2023. The credit facility backstops the company's commercial paper program, which Target typically uses to fund seasonal working capital in advance of the holiday selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., Target undertook several initiatives to support liquidity. In March 2020, Target issued $1.5 billion in notes due April 2025 and $1 billion in notes due in September 2030. In April 2020, the company entered into a $900 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in April 2021. As of May 2, 2020, there were no balances outstanding on the new credit facility, which Fitch has assigned at 'A-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target has historically generated good free cash flow, which has averaged $2.3 billion over the past three years. Given EBITDA declines in 2020, somewhat mitigated by capex reductions, FCF is expected to moderate but remain ample at over $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Total principal debt outstanding as of May 2, 2020, was $12.7 billion with the next sizable maturity $1 billion in unsecured notes due January 2022. Fitch expects the company to maintain lease adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing operating lease expense at 8x) around 2.0x beginning 2021, similar to its recent history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch adjusts for stock based compensation. For example, Fitch reclassified $147 million in non-cash stock based compensation to non-operating expense for the year ended Feb. 2020.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-01 June 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned an 'A+' rating to Amazon's proposed $10 billion in unsecured notes, which Fitch expects will be used for general corporate purposes, including funding equipment currently funded through capital lease arrangements. As such, the issuance is expected to be a leverage-neutral event over time with minimal impact to Amazon's longer-term credit profile. Fitch has also affirmed Amazon's existing ratings, including its 'A+' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and its 'F1+' Short-Term IDR. The Outlook is Positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's rating reflects its strong positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale, strong FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) at 1.7x in 2019. The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals. The Positive Outlook reflects the company's strengthening operating and financial profile, including better than expected revenue, EBITDA and cash flow over the past several years and increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR remaining below 2.0x over time. Understanding the scope and impact around ongoing regulatory activity and more clarity regarding the company's evolving business model and longer-term ambitions - particularly with regard to future growth platforms - would provide Fitch increased confidence in Amazon maintaining its existing credit profile over time, which could yield to a positive rating action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2019, Amazon reported revenue of $281 billion and EBITDA of $43 billion (adding back $6.9 billion in non-cash stock based compensation expense). Fitch expects annual revenue growth of around 20% in 2020 and 10%-12% beginning in 2021, with consolidated revenue expected to surpass $400 billion in 2022. This follows average annual revenue growth of 26% over the last five years. Fitch projects EBITDA (prior to the impact of Fitch's updated criteria related to finance leases which negatively impacts EBITDA by approximately $11 billion in 2020) to grow toward $70 billion by 2022 from $43 billion in 2019, as EBITDA margins modestly improve toward 17% in 2022 from 15% in 2019. Near term, EBITDA margin in 2020 is expected to decline to around 12% in 2020 due to expenses from the coronavirus; Fitch-calculated EBITDA margin inclusive of the updated lease criteria could be in the mid-8% range. Margin improvement from the relatively stronger growth in Amazon's higher margin <span class="companylink">Amazon Web Services</span> (AWS) business is expected to be somewhat mitigated by structural increases to e-commerce operating expenses resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The coronavirus pandemic could prove a watershed moment for Amazon's longer-term business prospects. The e-commerce channel is expected to become further embedded in consumer shopping patterns, particularly in historically underpenetrated categories like grocery, where Amazon could be a significant player over time. AWS could capitalize on a variety of societal impacts, including corporate desire for operating flexibility (e.g., through use of the cloud or other AWS features) and increased remote work arrangements. The company's flexible business model, including its suite of assets in technology, media, and logistics, could allow Amazon to strengthen its existing business lines while exploring new avenues for future growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Risks to Amazon's credit profile include some uncertainty around Amazon's long-term operating path given its potential to expand to new verticals, and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's scale and business practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Positions from Superior Strategy and Execution</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As a true disrupter, Amazon has built leading positions in its primary industry verticals. From its beginnings as an online bookseller to its current business model of online general merchant and provider of cloud computing services, Amazon's strategic foresight and strong execution have yielded leading e-commerce and cloud computing market shares. Amazon's innovations also include its Prime shipping subscription service and increased optionality for customer collection of products, including Amazon lockers and Whole Foods locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's efforts provided customers greater comfort in making online purchases but also forged a path of innovation and capabilities that others have strived to emulate. AWS, which grew out of Amazon's internal efforts to service its growing online retail business, has similarly helped to establish the cloud computing industry and offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Today, Amazon's global online product and digital media sales of roughly $141 billion (excluding sales by third party resellers on Amazon's websites) is significantly larger than the online business of its peers, with only <span class="companylink">eBay</span> close at approximately $90 billion of gross merchandise value. Fitch estimates that AWS' $35 billion in 2019 revenue yields a roughly 50% market share in the Iaas segment compared with around 20% for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and mid-single digit share for <span class="companylink">Google</span>. Outside of IaaS, AWS currently has minimal presence in other areas of cloud services such as SaaS where <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> is estimated to represent over 50% of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's success has led to exponential growth in Amazon's EBITDA, FCF and cash position. In 2019, the company generated $43.2 billion in EBITDA, 30% higher than 2017 and over 8x the $5.1 billion generated in 2013. FCF in 2019 was $21.7 billion, or 7.7% of revenue, after $16.9 billion (or 6% of sales) of capex. The company ended 2019 with $49 billion of cash and equivalents, compared with $52 billion of book debt (inclusive of approximately $27 billion in finance leases, prior to the change in Fitch's financing lease criteria).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Connections and Suite of Assets Yield Operating Flexibility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Amazon's leadership position and scale, supported by good strategic foresight and execution, has created a virtuous circle of growth and investment for the company. Amazon's customer connections, importance to merchandise vendors and other suppliers, and meaningful cash flow generation allow it to operate from a position of strength. The company has established significant loyalty amongst customers, providing some stickiness -- particularly through Prime -- in a highly competitive retail landscape. These attributes provide the company maneuverability to quickly execute changes and an ability to expand its operation in ways not traditionally seen for either retailers or technology firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Retailers of third-party products must establish a value proposition with customers that balances price and service. For example, in return for strong price-value in the discount channel (including discounters and dollar stores) customers are willing to accept reduced sales assistance, less-frequently-updated store environments, and reduced service elements like fewer product options and more stringent return/exchange policies. This compares with higher-priced competitors like single category big-box retailers that offer better product selection and higher service. Consumers accept this tradeoff between price and service as they make channel decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has built a reputation for having not only low prices but also a reasonable customer experience. The company is known for pricing near brick-and-mortar discounter peers but with good and reliable service elements like multiple shipping options, product tracking information, ease of shopping process, and so on. Over time, Amazon has enhanced its service offering, including increasing product selection, reducing delivery times, shortening the checkout process, and expanding product pick-up and return options. As such, the Amazon brand is favorably viewed by customers across many attributes; this favorable view has allowed the company to expand its umbrella of offerings, including AWS. Fitch expects the company to not only grow its existing businesses but to expand in new categories and verticals more quickly than an average new entrant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's growth flexibility is enhanced by its suite of assets. While Fitch believes a strong physical footprint is vital to an effective omnichannel strategy, brick-and-mortar retailers are somewhat encumbered by their existing store base; altering or moving their footprints is expensive, time consuming, and limited by lease arrangements. As a primarily internet-focused retailer, Amazon is mostly without these concerns. In addition, Amazon can easily make customer-facing changes to its site, including product display arrays, inventory availability and information, and product pricing, all of which can be challenging for physical retailers to change quickly, accurately, and uniformly across a large store base. Amazon's 'endless aisle' also allows it to expand product and category breadth over time, enhancing revenue generating opportunities. Similarly, AWS's cloud-based approach offers the ability to expand its suite of services as new opportunities are identified and capabilities are developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes customer loyalty and flexible operating assets enable Amazon to stretch its business model in any number of directions. As discussed in the next section, Amazon's future growth avenues could include verticals in such far-flung industries as logistics, healthcare and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Exposure to Growth Markets and Verticals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Partly a result of its own path-forging that helped to establish new industry verticals, Amazon is exposed to several high-growth markets including cloud services and e-commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >AWS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch projects IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) to experience CAGR of 28% and 23%, respectively, between 2017 and 2021, higher than 18% for overall cloud services. As AWS is primarily exposed to IaaS and PaaS, Fitch expects Amazon to benefit from the industry tailwind. The industry growth is supported by enterprise customers' migration from on-premise IT resources to more efficient and flexible cloud-based resources. In addition, cloud services also enable enterprise customers to gain access to new services that are more efficiently deployed in the cloud including artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, etc. In addition, as the world adapts to working remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic, cloud services have proven to provide the necessary IT resilience and accessibility to support a more distributed work force. Fitch believes that these factors will support cloud industry growth through the medium term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's AWS is a leader in the cloud services industry with nearly 50% market share in the IaaS segment with closest competitors <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s Azure at over 20% market share and <span class="companylink">Google</span> Cloud in high-single-digits. The scale advantage enables AWS to price its infrastructure services competitively and maintain its market leadership. In spite of the leadership position, the commonly adopted multi-cloud IT implementation by enterprise customers is likely to prevent AWS from consolidating market share of over 50% as scale competitors gradually close the market share gaps with AWS maintaining its lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >AWS has consistently generated divisional EBITDA margins of approximately 50% (before stock-based compensation add-back); Fitch estimates EBITDA from AWS to reach approximately $25 billion in 2020. Fitch expects the strong EBITDA margins to remain stable through Fitch's forecast period supported by AWS's substantial scale advantage over its competitors that provides AWS with pricing flexibility while maintaining strong profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >E-commerce</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch estimates e-commerce grew around 15% in 2019 to approximately $600 billion, or 16% of retail sales excluding auto and gasoline. Online penetration would be closer to one-third, excluding low-penetration categories, such as grocery. Online growth in 2020 is expected to accelerate compared with prior years, as evidenced by Amazon's nearly 30% 1Q20 growth in North America, due to both temporary store closures and shelter in place activity related to the coronavirus pandemic. Fitch expects that over time, online growth will increasingly be supported by a strong physical store network that is required to provide customer service, product marketing and point of distribution. Scalability challenges for online-only players will likely cap growth without creating a physical presence or partnering with an incumbent retailer. Fitch considers Amazon's strategic moves including the acquisition of Whole Foods, collaborations with retailers like <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corporation</span> (BBB-/Negative), and establishment of lockers as steps toward a robust omnichannel model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Within retail, key categories such as grocery remain underpenetrated. Grocery, with an estimated sales base of at least $700 billion, has seen online penetration hover in the low single digit range largely due to the complexity of delivery operations for temperature-specific food, pressurized products such as soda, and perishables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has well-publicized goals to grow its grocery market share. Initiatives such as the purchase of Whole Foods, expansion of its AmazonFresh grocery delivery business to new geographies, and experimentation with the AmazonGo store with minimal checkout process have been designed to reduce shopping/shipping times and improve customer experience. The Whole Foods stores are not only important outlets for customer shopping and pickup but also reduce the expensive 'last-mile' delivery cost in their generally densely populated, socioeconomically attractive neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The coronavirus pandemic is leading to significant growth in, and trial of, online grocery orders, including delivery and curbside pickup, resulting from restaurant closures and consumer desire to minimize time in public places. Customer appreciation of omnichannel grocery models could fundamentally change the direction of channel mix of the category. Given its strong customer connections and suite of technology and logistics assets, Amazon is well positioned to lead online grocery growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Internationally, Amazon has established relationships with the U.K.'s <span class="companylink">Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC</span> and France's <span class="companylink">Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA</span> to sell their food products on Amazon websites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has also made public its ambitions in apparel. Fitch estimates Amazon's current share of the approximate $250 billion U.S. apparel market is around 8%, making it one of the largest U.S. sellers of apparel, and is primarily lower-cost, basics oriented product. Fitch believes Amazon could continue to expand its apparel presence, particularly in basics and lower-priced branded goods. The company is likely to benefit from increased store closure activity across the specialty and department store space; store closures could accelerate following the coronavirus pandemic given increased financial distress for weaker brick and mortar retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving Financial Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's financial profile has improved in recent years across a number of metrics. Annual revenue has grown at an average of over 25% over the past five years. Growth in recent years has been most pronounced at AWS with topline gains of 47% and 37% in 2018 and 2019, respectively; however, strong growth has continued in global e-commerce, plus the 2017 addition of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> stores. The company has significantly expanded its business while diversifying its presence across verticals and geographies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As a result of revenue growth, EBITDA expanded to $43.2 billion in 2019 from $6.4 billion in 2014. EBITDA margins have improved to 15.4% in 2019 from 7.2% in 2014. Margin improvement has been largely due to strong growth at higher-margin AWS. AWS margins have trended around 50% in recent years, while the North American business saw EBITDA margin improvement to 7.1% in 2019 from 3.1% in 2014. International segment EBITDA was essentially breakeven in both 2014 and 2019 topline growth during the period as the company increased investments in new markets such as India. For reference, segment EBITDA figures do not add back non-cash equity compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth in EBITDA has led to substantial FCF generation, despite increasing capex intensity. In 2019, for example, Amazon generated $21.7 billion in FCF after spending nearly $17 billion on capex. The company has not historically paid a dividend or executed share repurchases since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's increasing cash flow generation and stable-to-improving segment-level profitability at AWS and North America dispel the myth that Amazon's strategy is 'growth at any price'. While the company continues to heavily spend on growth through calculated investments that offer attractive longer-term returns, it does so with an increasingly attractive near-term financial profile. In fact, Amazon's North America EBITDA margin, at 7.1% in 2019, before adding back equity compensation, compares favorably with leading retailer <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> at around 6.0%. AWS EBITDA margins in the 50% range are comparable to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, and compare favorably to <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> in the low-40% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon ended 2019 with $52 billion in debt, including $27 billion of finance leases, compared with $16 billion in debt at the end of 2016. After the company issued or assumed $17 billion in debt in 2017 related to the Whole Foods transaction, adjusted leverage in 2017 increased to 2.5x from 1.7x in 2016 and compares with the recent peak of 3.0x in 2014. Amazon ended 2019 with adjusted debt/EBITDAR at 1.7x and $49 billion in cash and cash equivalents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects continued strong EBITDA growth (before the impact of Fitch's adoption of updated finance lease criteria, which negatively impacts EBITDA by approximately $11 billion in 2020) over the next three years, despite a decline of around 10% in 2020 due to incremental expenses related to the coronavirus pandemic, including wages, cleaning, and reduced operational productivity resulting from social distancing measures at distribution facilities. EBITDA before finance lease amortization expense could reach $70 billion by 2022 from $43 billion in 2019, given ongoing growth in the AWS business and stabilization of EBITDA margins at the North American business beginning 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF, before the impact of finance lease amortization, could moderate to the $7 billion to $10 billion range in 2020 from $22 billion in 2019, but improve toward $25 billion in 2022. Fitch's updated lease amortization criteria impacts Fitch-calculated FCF by around $10 billion in 2020, as it is considered an operating expense mitigated by a financing cash inflow; the impact is expected to moderate by around $2 billion annually beginning 2021 as capital leases roll off. Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which was 1.7x in 2019, could increase to around 2.6x in 2020 on EBITDA declines and the proposed notes issuance, but moderate to below 2.0x beginning 2021 on EBITDA growth and the roll-off of finance lease arrangements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Open Strategic Growth Path Yields Uncertainty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While the company has a proven track record of growing EBITDA and generating significant FCF, Amazon has also made outsized growth investments. The company has shown comfort in and propensity to make large investments in areas that could be significantly margin dilutive with a longer-term investment time horizon. While Fitch expects the company to look toward new avenues of growth, Amazon's primary source of cash flow and earnings is expected to remain sourced from its existing e-commerce and AWS businesses, for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For example, Fitch expects Amazon's lack of international segment EBITDA growth despite topline expansion have been caused by growth investments in new geographies such as India, as opposed to declines in more mature markets like Germany, the U.K. and Japan. These investments are essentially funded by cash flow generated elsewhere in the Amazon ecosystem. While the growth strategy weighs on near-term operating results, long-term growth in markets such as India should help Amazon stabilize and grow international profitability over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has made numerous acquisitions of various sizes and competencies over the past 20 years, illustrating the company's open strategic path and willingness to pursue new capabilities as part of its growth strategy. As an example, the company spent approximately $14 billion in 2017 on three acquisitions (most notably <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span>), each of which has limited business overlap with one another, but all of which ultimately support Amazon's goal of broadening product selection and customer optionality. In 2018, Amazon spent approximately $1.7 billion on acquisitions buying home security company, Ring Inc., and <span class="companylink">PillPack, Inc</span>., an online pharmacy; the company made only modest acquisitions in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Amazon has ample ability to invest in its business through internally generated cash flow. Fitch assumes the company will generate cash flow before capex of around 15% of revenue over the longer term, with 2020/2021 results closer to 10% due to coronavirus-related expenses. This would allow Amazon to generate meaningful FCF even if capital intensity accelerates from 2019's 6.0%. However, Amazon's potential investments in new verticals, including sizable acquisitions, yield some risk of leverage increases over time. Its willingness to experiment with and invest in unproven business opportunities yields some risk of not only leveraging transactions but also outsized investments, which could yield disappointing ROI and pressure operating metrics. Amazon's growth trajectory at an increasing revenue volume also necessitates an influx of human capital over time; its ability to execute its strategies is somewhat dependent on its ability to successfully hire and onboard talent to accomplish its objectives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's rating case assumes Amazon's adjusted debt/EBITDAR returns to below 2.0x over the next two years but incorporates room for the company to make outsized investments or acquisitions that would yield leverage remaining modestly above 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Regulatory Scrutiny</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Justice</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Trade Commission</span> have decided to divide regulatory oversight over four large technology companies including Amazon, <span class="companylink">Alphabet Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>., and <span class="companylink">Facebook, Inc</span>.; this action and increased political discussion around Big Tech have led to speculation about increased regulatory oversight over companies like Amazon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In July 2019 the EU announced an inquiry into Amazon's use of data collected from third parties that sell on its websites, though little has been heard since the inquiry was opened. More recently, concerns have arisen about Amazon's use of third party merchant sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Outcomes could range from no impact to forced operational changes, which in Amazon's case could include a breakup of the company. Fines or other penalties could be levied if the company was found to commit any wrongdoing relative to competitive practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >New Business Opportunities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has either made inroads in, or is rumored to be interested in, a number of opportunities both adjacent to its current verticals and somewhat afield of its major business lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Logistics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Core to Amazon's success as an online retailer is its distribution network. The company has more than 175 fulfillment centers worldwide, with over 110 in North America. In 2017, the company also expanded its distribution network through the purchase of over 460 <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> retail locations and agreement with <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> to test in-store returns of Amazon orders. In June 2019, the company announced a partnership with Rite Aid, which offers staffed pick-up counters for online Amazon orders at its stores. Amazon also currently manages lockers in over 900 U.S. cities and towns for secure deliveries and has tested drone deliveries of products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In April 2019, the company announced its intentions to roll out free one-day delivery for Prime members. This announcement has encouraged other online competitors to follow, including <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> and Target. In order to achieve their distribution goals, in June 2019 Amazon announced that it would lease an additional 15 <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> (<span class="companylink">Boeing Company</span>, BBB/Negative) 737s, alongside its current fleet of approximately 40 767 aircrafts. The company expects to have a rented fleet of about 70 planes by 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's expanding network allows it to in-source more of its delivery operations over time. This move could lower delivery costs, reduce delivery times through simplifying warehouse-to-customer paths, and provide Amazon with incremental data to inform decision-making on future plans. Amazon is also increasingly using its network to service third party merchants that sell products on Amazon's site. Since fourth-quarter 2018, over half of the units sold on Amazon's sites were sold by third-party merchants; Fitch expects many of these utilize Amazon's fulfillment infrastructure to deliver goods and therefore participate in Amazon's Prime delivery offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Voice Recognition/Smart Home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Through Alexa Voice Service, Amazon is expanding its voice recognition competencies and use cases. Voice recognition was introduced in Amazon's Echo speaker products in 2014, originally allowing users to interface on tasks such as music playback, composition of to-do lists and receipt of information like news and weather. The company's acquisition of Ring further expands its presence in the smart home category given Ring's home security focus. Amazon is continually expanding Alexa's capabilities and now sells this functionality to third parties for integration with products ranging from consumer electronics to smart home products to autos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Healthcare</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon is increasingly rumored to be a healthcare disruptor which Fitch views as logical given the sector's size and more durable spend relative to retail in general and Amazon's core competencies. Anecdotal evidence adds credence. Over the last year, Amazon has demonstrated interest in both the payer side and the distribution side of the healthcare industry. In 2018, Amazon entered into a joint venture with <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>. Additionally, in 2018, Amazon acquired <span class="companylink">PillPack</span>, an online pharmacy. Growth at <span class="companylink">PillPack</span> is expected to take share from incumbent mail order players as opposed to retail pharmacies given consumer preferences. Fitch notes that given customer preference for in-person pharmaceutical purchases, already razor thin pharmacy margins and contractual pricing structures (limiting Amazon's ability to undercut prices), Amazon's ability to quickly gain critical mass and scale in this business could be more muted than its gains in other consumer categories. Fitch believes Amazon could use its data analytics capabilities to compete with PBMs on optimizing health care plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Business-to-business drug or medical supply delivery could be a simpler way for Amazon to exploit its asset base. However, Fitch does not view Amazon's entry as having the same level of disruption as it did on retail. The sector is not fragmented like retail was, with around 85%-90% share of the B2B drug distribution industry held by three large players - McKesson Corp (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Cardinal Health, Inc</span>. (BBB/Stable) and <span class="companylink">AmerisourceBergen Corp</span> (A-/Stable). Fitch views healthcare distribution to be extremely competitive given relatively undifferentiated capabilities, low switching costs and high fixed costs. Moreover, Fitch does not view Amazon's strengths as being material improvements to customer or supplier experiences the way that it was in bookstores (e.g. customers benefited from greater choice and easier search while publishers had better working capital management as they did not face the same level of returns since Amazon ordered most inventory after customer orders).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes that Amazon will continue to use its size and scale to penetrate the healthcare industry, albeit at a conservative pace as they carefully evaluate what is profitable and economical for them to enter. Considering current regulatory uncertainty in Washington regarding the pharmaceutical and health benefits industry, Fitch does not believe that Amazon has near-term plans to purchase a healthcare company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Media</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes Amazon's 'Prime Video' over-the-top (OTT) offering is principally geared toward increasing Prime membership retention through an incremental service offering. This distinguishes Amazon from its primary OTT peers Netflix and Hulu, whose content do not support a broader subscription offering. Content popularity and quality (often measured by awards recognition) may also have a positive halo effect on Amazon's overall brand resonance with consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects the OTT model will continue to gain prominence as the secular shift to viewing on a digital and mobile platform continues. Over time, should Amazon successfully develop core capabilities in filmed entertainment production, it could leverage this asset through increased distribution of Amazon-produced content or offer various services to third-party content providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's Prime Video content platform is still more of a content aggregator than producer of original content. The company has seen limited, but improving, traction with its original content, most notably Transparent and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Amazon has also had a significant amount of leadership turnover in the Entertainment division, which Fitch believes signals an altered strategy and shift towards wider-appeal and more mainstream content. Fitch notes that some of Amazon's content spend will go towards the acquisition of sports rights which generally represent the stickiest content given the appointment nature of sports viewership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial Services</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As part of AWS, Amazon provides clients access to vetted third parties in a variety of financial services verticals such as banking/payments, insurance and financial data analytics. Over time, Fitch expects Amazon could use data gathered from these efforts along with its strong customer relationships as an opportunity to directly provide financial services to business clients. Regulatory overlay may add modest complications to a financial services vertical relative to other Amazon opportunities, but the company should be able to use its scale to work through regulatory issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's 'A+' Long-Term IDR reflects its strong positions in global e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale, strong FCF generation and reasonable leverage profile with adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x) at 1.7x in 2019. The rating considers the company's impressive track record of strategic vision and execution and its flexible operating platform, which provides growth opportunities across numerous verticals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Positive Outlook reflects the company's strengthening operating and financial profile, including better than expected revenue, EBITDA and cash flow over the past several years and increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR remaining below 2.0x over time. Understanding the scope and impact around the recent regulatory activity and more clarity regarding the company's evolving business model and longer-term ambitions - particularly with regard to future growth platforms - would provide Fitch increased confidence in Amazon maintaining its existing credit profile over time, which could lead to a positive rating action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's rated retail and e-commerce peers include <span class="companylink">Walmart, Inc</span>. (AA/Stable), <span class="companylink">Target Corporation</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">eBay, Inc</span>. (BBB/Stable). <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $524 billion of 2019 (ended January 2020) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage over time. While Amazon's 2019 EBITDA of $43 billion surpassed <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>'s of $32 billion for the first time, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has significantly greater share in its key market (U.S. retail) and a demonstrated commitment to maintaining leverage around 2.0x to support its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Target's ratings relative to <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> consider its smaller scale, history of inconsistent comp performance, exposure to disrupted and more cyclical categories like apparel and home, higher margins, and historically similar leverage profile. <span class="companylink">eBay</span>'s ratings reflect its revenue scale of over $10 billion and GMV of approximately $85 billion in the e-commerce segment that competes against Amazon's 3rd party seller platform. Its gross leverage is projected to remain stable at approximately 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For AWS, Fitch compares against cloud service industry peers including <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> (AA+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> (A-/Negative). From an IaaS perspective, AWS has a substantially larger scale (approximately 50% share) than both of these competitors. However, these competitors have significant legacy enterprise products that are able to support continuing investments in cloud services and provide customer access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With annual revenue approaching $140 billion, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s ratings reflect its dominant position and cash generation from its combination of legacy software products and cloud-based products, with gross leverage approaching 1x and strong cash on balance sheet placing the company in a net cash position. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>' s ratings - with $40 billion in annual revenues - reflect its solid position in the ERP segment that provides substantial cash generation, with elevated gross leverage at over 3x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--North America (61% and 41% of 2019 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Fitch anticipates annual organic revenue growth, which has been around 20% to 25% the past four years, to be at least 10% longer term, as Fitch projects Amazon should at least hold market share in an e-commerce retail channel, which is expected to grow 10% to 15%. Revenue in 2020 could grow 20% or more (up nearly 30% in 1Q) on increased e-commerce spending during the coronavirus pandemic; as such 2021 revenue could moderate to around 5% on a challenging comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >North America EBITDA margins, which were 7% in 2019, could moderate toward breakeven in 2020 on heightened operating expenses related to the coronavirus. Margins could rebound beginning 2021 although remain below 2019's 7% as some increased 2020 expenses could become permanent in Amazon's cost structure. As such, EBITDA could contract from $12 billion in 2019 toward breakeven in 2020 but rebound to the $13 billion range by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--AWS (12% and 58% of 2019 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Revenue growth, which has averaged around 45% over the past four years, is expected to trend around 35% in 2020 and moderate toward 25% by 2022, in line with Fitch's forecast for cloud services industry growth. EBITDA margins are expected to trend near the 50% range, similar to recent history, yielding EBITDA expanding toward $34 billion in 2022 from around $17 billion in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--International (27% and 1% of 2019 revenue and allocated segment EBITDA, respectively): Segment revenue growth, which has averaged around 20% over the past four years, is projected to grow around 8% annually longer term, with growth closer to 15% in 2020 due to the pandemic. EBITDA is expected to turn negative over the next three years given increased operating expenses resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The above assumptions yield overall annual revenue growth of around 20% in 2020 and the 10% range beginning 2021, with consolidated revenue expected to reach $410 billion by 2022. Fitch projects EBITDA (before the impact of the adoption of Fitch's finance lease accounting criteria) to grow toward around $60 billion by 2022 from approximately $43 billion in 2019, although EBITDA could decline around 10% to the $39 billion range in 2020 on expense growth. EBITDA margins could rebound toward 17% in 2022 from around 12% in 2020, modestly higher than the 15% recorded in 2019, as above company-average topline growth by the higher-margin AWS business is somewhat mitigated by higher e-commerce operating expenses. Fitch-calculated EBITDA in 2020 could be around $28 billion following its finance lease accounting criteria change, which includes finance lease amortization as an operating expense deducted from EBITDA. Fitch-calculated EBITDA is expected to be negatively impacted around $10 billion to $11 billion annually based on the criteria change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow before capex (and before the impact of Fitch's updated finance lease criteria), which was $39 billion in 2019, could trend in the mid-$30 billion range in 2020 but expand to over $60 billion by 2022 on EBITDA growth. Assuming Amazon could continue to accelerate growth investments, driving capex intensity toward 7.5% to 8.5% beginning 2020 from 6.0% in 2019, FCF before the impact of finance lease accounting treatment would increase toward $32 billion by 2022 from $21.7 billion in 2019, despite 2020 EBITDA declines. Fitch-calculated FCF could be modestly negative at around negative $2 billion given its updated finance lease accounting criteria, which includes finance lease amortization as an operating expense and financing cash inflow. The criteria change is expected to impact Fitch-calculated FCF by around $11 billion in 2020, with the impact declining by around $2 billion annually thereafter as capital leases roll off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing rent at 8x), which had declined from a recent peak of 3.0x in 2014 to 1.7x in 2016, rose to 2.5x in 2017 following the debt-financed acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon finished 2019 with adjusted leverage at 1.7x. Adjusted leverage in 2020 expected to rise to 2.6x, due to the proposed unsecured notes issuance and EBITDA declines. Adjusted leverage is projected to return below 2.0x beginning 2021 on EBITDA growth and as finance leases roll off. While Amazon is expected to have ample internally generated cash flow with which to invest in its business, the company could make temporarily leveraging transactions such as the Whole Foods acquisition. Amazon could also use FCF to reduce debt as it did as recently as 2015, although this is not factored into Fitch's base case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--To upgrade Amazon to the 'AA' category, Fitch would need increased confidence in Amazon's ability to maintain its current credit profile following any outcome to ongoing regulatory activity. Fitch would also need greater clarity regarding the company's longer-term business model, particularly with regard to future growth platforms, to consider an upgrade;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--In addition to the above, Amazon would need to provide a publicly articulated financial framework or a demonstrated record of maintaining a consistent credit profile, yielding increased confidence in adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) sustaining under 2.0x combined with operating performance that is in line with Fitch's current expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material slowdown in Amazon's growth trajectory with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 2.5x due to weaker-than-expected EBITDA, sizeable investments in new business verticals which limit EBITDA expansion or debt-financed M&A. The outcome of any regulatory activity that would adversely impact Amazon's credit profile would also be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: Amazon reported $49.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31, 2020, which combined with the company's undrawn $7 billion unsecured revolver due to mature in April 2021 , totals $56.3 billion in liquidity. Approximately 77% of Amazon's cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. dollars, while the remaining approximately 23% are held primarily in Euros, Japanese Yen and British Pounds. The company's short-term investments are reported as market securities, consisting of government and agency bonds, 'AAA' rated money market funds and investment grade fixed-income securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2018, the company initiated a commercial paper program, backed by its $7 billion unsecured revolver, which was upsized from $3 billion with its maturity extended to April 2021. Fitch expects commercial paper usage to primarily support seasonal working capital swings but could also support M&A activity or other investments for longer-term growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Amazon</b>.<b>com</b>, <b>Inc</b></span>. is the issuer of all debt, including its unsecured revolver, CP program, and approximately $23 billion of senior unsecured notes as of March 31, 2019. The company has approximately $1 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing in each of the next three years. Fitch expects the company to refinance these maturities as they come due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon has chosen to enter into finance leases (formerly termed capital leases), generally with three to five year terms, for some of its infrastructure, particularly facilities supporting AWS, given its low cost of capital and desire to preserve cash for investment optionality. Per Fitch's criteria, the company's finance lease arrangements are capitalized at 4.0x annual operating expenses (including amortization and interest). Finance lease amortization and interest expense, like operating lease expense, are now considered operating expenses by Fitch and are deducted from EBITDA and FCF; these expenses, which are expected to be around $11 billion in 2020 but decline several billion per year as capital leases roll off, would be added back in Fitch's EBITDAR calculation and added to Fitch's financing cash flow calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has proposed the issuance of $10 billion in unsecured notes, which Fitch expects would be used to replace future capital lease arrangements. As such, while the issuance has a leveraging impact on Fitch's 2020 forecast for Amazon, the issuance is expected to be leverage neutral over time as existing finance leases roll off and are not replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Amazon's unsecured debt balance could grow modestly over time to support growth initiatives, though Amazon could use FCF to reduce debt as it has on occasion in the past. Alternatively, the company could choose to issue debt to execute M&A activities, such as the debt-financed Whole Foods acquisition in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch has adjusted the historical and projected debt by adding 8x yearly operating lease expense. Fitch has also adjusted projected debt by adding 4x yearly finance lease expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch removed $6.9 billion of share based compensation from operating expenses for the year ended Dec. 31, 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity(ies), either due to their nature or to the way in which they are being managed by the entity(ies).

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>
