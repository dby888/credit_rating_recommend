</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-01 July 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span>'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed <b>Intel</b>'s Short-Term IDR and commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that FCF margins, adjusted for capital spending offsets, on average will be modestly positive through our forecast period (2024-2027). Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA leverage metrics will improve but will remain outside of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s previous negative rating sensitivity through 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes execution risk remains significant for <b>Intel</b> and that missteps could result in further negative rating actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, the successful execution on <b>Intel</b>'s strategy to regain process technology leadership and build the leading foundry services business in the U.S. and Europe could support a return to the A-category. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not expect this to be apparent in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Weaker FCF Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s investment super-cycle to result in modestly positive FCF after capital spending offsets in aggregate over the next several years. However, FCF margins will be in the low-single digits, which is more in line with the 'BBB' rating category. Additionally, these margins are considerably weaker than similarly-rated semiconductor peers. <b>Intel</b>'s execution on its strategy depends on a significant degree of capital spending over the next several years. Funding for this spending will in large part come from offsets, including co-investment programs and U.S. and European government subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates FCF to fluctuate with the timing of capital spending and offsets through the forecast period. Over the longer term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s FCF profile to strengthen due to structurally higher profitability from closing the process technology gap and capital intensity normalizing near 25%, down from a Fitch-forecasted approximately 50% in 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates this is in line with <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.</span>'s (<span class="companylink">TSMC</span>) investment intensity focused on the leading-edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage Elevated Longer: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts improving leverage metrics through the forecast period; however, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not expect EBITDA leverage to be below our 2.5x negative rating sensitivity until 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts EBITDA leverage near 3.75x in 2024 and a full turn of improvement to 2.75x in 2025 from higher profitability, since <b>Intel</b> should not need to increase debt levels. High cash balances result in net leverage near 2.0x, providing sufficient cushion to support liquidity through this investment cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects structurally higher investment intensity, given <b>Intel</b>'s commitment to regaining process technology leadership and building out its foundry services business. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes management's $15 billion external customer revenue by 2030 target for the foundry services business may limit capital spending moderation. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s 25% capital intensity long-term target is in line with what current technology leader, <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, spends on the leading edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pressure on Operating Performance: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects new products based on <b>Intel</b>'s process technology transitions to drive positive revenue growth and profit margin expansion through the forecast period, albeit from current near-record lows. Excess inventory throughout the supply chain continues to weigh on revenue and profit margins in 1H24 after revenue and EBITDA margins were down meaningfully in each of the last two years. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts solid revenue growth over the next few years with EBITDA margin expansion in the 40% range from the high 20% range in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s credit profile benefits from the company's strong market positions in personal computers (PCs) and data centers (DCs), despite share erosion in servers to its traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</span> (AMD), and ARM-based custom servers. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things and automotive markets should offset share losses. In addition, new product technology introductions over the next several years should stabilize share losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s profile is in line with the 'BBB+' rating. Strong strategy execution, combined with delevering over the next several years could result in a rating upgrade to the 'A' category. If not, there could be negative rating pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In a successful scenario, <b>Intel</b> becomes the advanced node semiconductor foundry of choice in the U.S. and Europe with sufficient scale to support ongoing technology leadership and the product company stems share losses. This hinges on the success of the company's process technology roadmap. In a negative scenario, there is a meaningful elongation of <b>Intel</b>'s investment super-cycle, most likely due to process technology transition challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> faces intensified competition from its rival AMD in both PCs and servers for DCs, as well as increasing utilization of custom ARM-based servers by cloud service provider customers. Nonetheless, <b>Intel</b>'s market share remains strong despite technology challenges and is poised to stabilize with new products set for production over the coming years. These include those sourced from the company's increased use of third-party foundry <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> for advanced products over the nearer term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >From both an operating and financial profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> is weaker than <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, considering <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>'s significant leadership in leading-edge foundry services, superior FCF profile and strong credit metrics. Nonetheless, geopolitical risk is significant for <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> (and its customers) and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b> has an inside track to become the advanced technology foundry supplier of choice in the U.S. and Europe, geographies in which semiconductor manufacturing is going to develop slowly but become significant over the longer term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In terms of similarly rated peers, <b>Intel</b> compares unfavorably with <span class="companylink">Qorvo Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Skyworks Solutions Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable), both of which have more conservative financial structures in order to offset greater end market and customer concentration than that of <b>Intel</b>. <span class="companylink">Qorvo</span> and <span class="companylink">Skyworks</span> have higher FCF margins due to lower investment intensity than that of <b>Intel</b>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">NXP Semiconductor N.V.</span> (BBB+/Stable), <b>Intel</b> also compares less favorably with weaker leverage metrics and lower financial flexibility. <b>Intel</b>'s market positions remain strong despite share losses over recent years and on this factor the company compares favorably to <span class="companylink">NXP</span>, as well as <b>Intel</b>'s 'BBB' category-rated semiconductor peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Equity Treatment for SCIP2: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s equity-like view on SCIP2 mainly reflects the variability of investment returns for <span class="companylink">Apollo</span>, the minority investor in the JV. The returns are subject to the JV's ability to meet <b>Intel</b>'s demand for leading-edge wafers, market demand for <b>Intel</b>'s products and <b>Intel</b>'s success attracting third-party foundry customers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> treats the first SCIP transaction as debt-like, as it believes that wafer purchases and returns to the minority investor are largely fixed. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will apply 100% equity treatment to SCIP2 and continue to adjust <b>Intel</b>'s debt quantum according to net flows from the SCIP1 minority investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low-single digit positive revenue growth in 2024, driven by the resumption of positive PC unit shipment growth in 2H24;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue grows by the high-single digits through the remainder of the forecast, reflecting improving competitive positioning and growth in the foundry services business;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins expand from the high 20% range for 2024 to 40% through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending remains elevated at more than 40% of revenue through the forecast period constrained by receipt of capital spending offsets;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat dividends and no stock buybacks;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> stabilizes share with EBITDA margins in the mid- to high-40% and FCF margins in the high single digits;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations that <b>Intel</b> will sustain EBITDA leverage below 2.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained negative organic revenue growth or expectations that <b>Intel</b> will not be able to expand gross profit margins due to technology challenges;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.5x beyond the intermediate term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative FCF beyond 2027 due to continued elevated capital intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b>'s liquidity will remain solid despite its investment super-cycle and, as of March 30, 2024, was supported by $21.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Liquidity is also supported by an undrawn $7.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due February 2029 and an undrawn $8.0 billion 364-day RCF expiring January 2025. This more than backstops the company's $10 billion CP program, under which $793 million was outstanding at quarter-end. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF (including capital spending offsets) will be positive in aggregate over the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp.</span> is the world's largest integrated design manufacturer, providing integrated circuits and related products into computing, internet of things and communications markets, in addition to providing foundry services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-04 June 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>’ ‘A-’/‘F2’ ratings and Negative Outlook for <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp.</span> are unaffected by the company’s announcement that it entered into a second co-investment program (SCIP2) that, unlike <b>Intel</b>’s first SCIP transaction, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as more equity-like and will not result in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> adjustments to <b>Intel</b>’s debt quantum for purposes of calculating credit metrics. SCIP2 will offset a portion of capital required to fund <b>Intel</b>’s investment super cycle but FCF, nonetheless, will still be negative through 2025 with leverage metrics outside of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s negative EBITDA leverage rating sensitivity, in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s previous forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >SCIP2 contemplates <b>Intel</b>’s sale of a 49% equity interest in a joint venture (JV) entity related to <b>Intel</b>’s largely-completed leading-edge high-volume manufacturing facility in Ireland (Fab 34) to Apollo for approximately $11 billion in cash. <b>Intel</b> has invested $18.4 billion on Fab 34 to date, adding flexibility for <b>Intel</b> to fund other capital spending. <b>Intel</b> will have a 51% controlling interest in the JV and retain full ownership and operational control of Fab 34 and its assets. <b>Intel</b> expects SCIP2 to close in the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s equity-like view on SCIP2 mainly reflects the variability of investment returns for Apollo, which is subject to the JV’s ability to meet <b>Intel</b>’s demand for leading-edge wafers, market demand for <b>Intel</b>’s products and <b>Intel</b>’s success attracting third-party foundry customers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> treats the first SCIP transaction as debt-like, given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s view that wafer purchases and returns to the minority investor are largely fixed. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> adjusts <b>Intel</b>’s debt quantum by net flows from the SCIP1 minority investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The JV will have rights to manufacture wafers at Fab 34 using <b>Intel</b> 4 and 3 process technologies to support demand for <b>Intel</b>’s products and provide capacity for foundry customers. Under the agreement, <b>Intel</b> is required to complete construction on the facility, although high volume manufacturing in Fab 34 already began in September 2023. The JV will sell wafers to <b>Intel</b> on a cost-plus-margin basis and the agreement requires <b>Intel</b> to meet volume commitments for its demand following the facility’s substantial completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> has agreed to preferential loading of Fab 34 relative to other <b>Intel</b> fabs running the same process and tooling and payment of liquidated damages to Apollo in various circumstances if <b>Intel</b> fails to meet minimum volume commitments, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as typical of wafer supply agreements. In addition, under various ancillary <b>Intel</b> and Apollo agreements, <b>Intel</b> or <b>Intel</b> Ireland may be required to pay liquidated damages or termination payments under various scenarios, including under-performance or termination, an amount up to 140% of Apollo’s purchase price. <b>Intel</b> will provide a parent guarantee to the obligations of <b>Intel</b> Ireland, which owns the Fab 34 assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects revenue to accelerate in second half of 2024 and through 2025 as <b>Intel</b> ramps new products amidst the resumption of positive personal computer (PC) unit shipment growth and robust artificial intelligence infrastructure spending. Start-up costs associated with <b>Intel</b>’s multiple process node transitions will constrain the pace of gross profit margin expansion but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA leverage back below 2x and resumption of positive FCF in 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts nearly $15 billion of cash usage over the 2024-2025 timeframe, which incorporates capital offsets from the SCIP programs and various forms of government support but excludes potential net proceeds from the monetization of <span class="companylink">Altera</span> or <span class="companylink">Mobileye</span>. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s forecast also incorporates continued inventory normalization.</p>

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-15 February 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned an 'A-' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp.</span>'s senior notes offering. The senior notes will be pari passu with <b>Intel</b>'s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> to use net proceeds from the senior notes offering to repay upcoming debt maturities and that the transaction will be leverage neutral. Estimated EBITDA leverage was 3.7x exiting 2023. <b>Intel</b> has approximately $2.3 billion of debt maturing in 2024 and another roughly $3.8 billion due in 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Intermediate-Term FCF: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF will be negative over the 2024-2025 period as <b>Intel</b> completes its investment super-cycle aimed at regaining manufacturing technology leadership and building out its foundry services business. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects cash balances to remain high in the $20 billion-$30 billion range. The company will fund cash burn with a combination of contributions from financial partners, government subsidies and tax benefits, net proceeds from the planned spin-off of the Programmable Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">PSG</span>) and asset monetization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> may fund remaining shortfalls with incremental debt. Higher debt and lower profitability exiting 2023 position the company's credit metrics weakly for the low 'A' rating category. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts improving profitability will drive Fitch-estimated EBITDA leverage to the mid- to high-2.0x range in 2024, down from 3.7x for 2023 (1.8x on a net leverage basis). Cash from operations (CFO)-capex/total debt (adjusted for JV-minority partner contributions) will be negative through 2025 before turning positive in 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects structurally higher investment intensity given <b>Intel</b>'s commitment to regaining process technology leadership and building out <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. <b>Intel</b>'s success, which would enable it to stem or reverse market share losses and gain a meaningful foothold in the $100 billion foundry addressable market, rather than moderate spending levels, will determine the company's ability to remain in the 'A' rating category. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is cautious on guidance for longer-term capital spending normalization, given that elevated spending levels are in line with technology leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual capital spending net of co-investments and subsidies of $20 billion-$25 billion (low- to mid-30% of revenue), up from an average of $15 billion (20% of revenue) in the 2016-2020 period. R&D adds another $15 billion-plus in non-GAAP spending on innovation with potential moderation related to the company's recent restructuring program announcement, up from an average of $13 billion per year between 2016 and 2020. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> will pursue additional co-investments and subsidies to defray spending levels, potentially reducing the drag on FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pressured Operating Performance: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects new products based upon <b>Intel</b>'s strengthening process technologies to drive positive revenue growth and profit margin expansion from current near-record low levels. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts above market revenue growth over the next few years with profit margin expansion partly offset by start-up costs associated with the company's process technology transitions. Revenue was down by the mid-teens in 2023 and EBITDA margins declined to a Fitch estimated 26%, roughly half of historical levels, despite <b>Intel</b> having achieved $3 billion of cost savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s credit profile benefits from the company's still strong market positions in personal computers (PC) and datacenter (DC), despite ongoing share erosion in servers to traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</span> (AMD), and ARM-based custom servers. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things (IoT) and automotive markets should offset share losses. In addition, new product technology introductions over the next several years should stabilize share and potentially reverse losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s weakened financial position within the context of its investment super-cycle and process technology disadvantage position it low for even the current 'A-' rating. Beyond the intermediate term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects considerably stronger profit margins and FCF but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is skeptical of a return to historical levels given ongoing investment requirements associated with the foundry services business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case contemplates recovering end markets in 2024, aided by product refreshes that should stabilize market share while <b>Intel</b>'s restructuring actions support profit margin expansion. Solid cash balances, co-investments and government subsidies should provide sufficient liquidity to fund capital spending, which, over the longer-term, position the company as a market leader with meaningful foundry services capabilities in the U.S. and Europe as customers look to diversify semiconductor supply chains. <b>Intel</b> may also fund investments by monetizing assets, including <span class="companylink">PSG</span> and IMS Nanofabrication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> faces intensified competition from rival AMD in both PCs and servers for DCs, as well as increasing utilization of custom ARM-based servers by cloud service provider customers. Nonetheless, <b>Intel</b>'s market share remains strong despite technology challenges and is poised to stabilize with new products set for production over the coming years, including those sourced from the company's increased use of third-party foundry <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> for advanced products over the nearer term. From both an operating and financial profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> is weaker than 'AA-'-rated <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, given that company's significant leadership in leading edge foundry services, superior FCF profile and strong credit metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Mid-single digit positive revenue growth in 2024, reflecting improved process technology and the resumption of positive PC unit shipment growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue grows by the mid- to high-single digits through the remainder of the forecast reflecting improving competitive positioning and modest growth in IFS;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margins expand to the mid- to high-50% range through the forecast period from a combination of positive revenue growth, benefits from <b>Intel</b>'s cost reduction initiatives and a richer sales mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margins expand from the mid-20% to the mid-40% through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending remains in the low- to mid-30s as a percentage of revenue with offsets from financial partners and government subsidies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> begins funding a portion of capex with net proceeds from divestitures, including <span class="companylink">PSG</span> in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat dividends and no stock buybacks;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities and plugs cash burn with a combination of divestitures, partnerships, government grants and incremental debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> regains a greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant growth in non-PC and DC segments resulting in greater revenue diversification, underscoring the company's technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations <b>Intel</b> will sustain EBITDA leverage near 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained negative organic revenue growth or expectations that <b>Intel</b> will not be able to sustain Fitch-adjusted gross profit margins above 50% due to a structurally weakened competitive position and product roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative FCF beyond 2025, underscoring failure in the company's technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.0x beyond the intermediate term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b>'s liquidity is pressured and, as of Dec. 30, 2023, was supported by $7.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $18.0 billion of short-term investments, an undrawn $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due March 2028 and undrawn $5.0 billion 364-day RCF expiring March 2024. The credit facilities fully back-stop <b>Intel</b>'s $10.0 billion CP program, under which no borrowings were outstanding at quarter-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will be negative over the next few years, requiring a combination of contributions from financial partners, government subsidies or, potentially, debt financing to fund the company's investment super-cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp.</span> is the world's largest integrated design manufacturer, providing integrated circuits and related products into computing, internet of things and communications markets, in addition to providing foundry services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-29 January 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span>'s (<b>Intel</b>) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'A-' and Short-Term IDR and CP rating at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook remains Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for negative FCF and weak credit metrics through the intermediate term as <b>Intel</b> invests aggressively to regain technology leadership and build out its foundry services business (<span class="companylink">IFS</span>). If successful, <b>Intel</b> will be positioned to reverse share losses and offer advanced foundry services in the U.S. and Europe, both economies pushing to reduce reliance on Taiwan for advanced chips. Success will also return <b>Intel</b>'s financial profile back in-line with the 'A' rating category, including funding higher capital intensity with cash from operations rather than incremental debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Intermediate-Term FCF: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF will be negative over the 2023-2025 period as <b>Intel</b> completes its investment super-cycle aimed at regaining manufacturing technology leadership and building out its foundry services business. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects cash balances to remain high in the $20 billion-$30 billion range. The company will fund cash burn with a combination of contributions from financial partners, government subsidies and tax benefits, net proceeds from the planned spin-off of the Programmable Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">PSG</span>) and other asset monetization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> may fund remaining shortfalls with incremental debt. Higher debt and lower profitability exiting 2023 positions the company's credit metrics weakly for the low 'A' rating category. We forecast improving profitability will drive Fitch-estimated EBITDA leverage to the mid-2.0x in 2024, down from 3.7x for 2023 (1.8x on a net leverage basis). CFO-capex/total debt (adjusted for JV-minority partner contributions) will be negative through 2025 before turning positive in 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects structurally higher investment intensity given <b>Intel</b>'s commitment to regaining process technology leadership and building out <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. <b>Intel</b>'s success, which would enable it to stem or reverse market share losses and gain a meaningful foothold in the $100 billion foundry addressable market, rather than moderate spending levels, will determine the company's ability to remain in the 'A' rating category. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is cautious on guidance for longer-term capital spending normalization, given that elevated spending levels are in line with technology leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual capital spending net of co-investments and subsidies of $20 billion-25 billion (low- to mid-30% of revenue), up from an average of $15 billion (20% of revenue) in the 2016-2020 period. R&D adds another $15+ billion in non-GAAP spending on innovation with potential moderation related to the company's recent restructuring program announcement, up from an average of $13 billion per year between 2016 and 2020. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> will pursue additional co-investments and subsidies to defray spending levels, potentially reducing the drag on FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pressured Operating Performance: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects new products based upon <b>Intel</b>'s strengthening process technologies to drive positive revenue growth and profit margin expansion from current near-record low levels. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts above market revenue growth over the next few years with profit margin expansion partly offset by start-up costs associated with the company's process technology transitions. Revenue was down by the mid-teens in 2023 and EBITDA margins declined to a Fitch estimated 26%, roughly half of historical levels despite <b>Intel</b> having achieved $3 billion of cost savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s credit profile benefits from the company's still strong market positions in personal computers (PC) and datacenter (DC), despite ongoing share erosion in servers to traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</span> (AMD), and ARM-based custom servers. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things (IoT) and automotive markets should offset share losses. In addition, new product technology introductions over the next several years should stabilize share and potentially reverse losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s weakened financial position within the context of its investment super-cycle and process technology disadvantage position it more in-line with a low-'A' category rating. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects negative FCF and weak leverage metrics over the intermediate-term, which is inconsistent with the company previous strong-'A' rating. Beyond the intermediate term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects considerably stronger profit margins and FCF but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is skeptical of a return to historical levels given ongoing investment requirements associated with the foundry services business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Our base case contemplates recovering end markets in 2024, aided by product refreshes that should stabilize market share while <b>Intel</b>'s restructuring actions support profit margin expansion. Solid cash balances, co-investments and government subsidies should provide sufficient liquidity to fund capital spending, which over the longer-term positions as a market leader with meaningful foundry services capabilities in the U.S. and Europe as customers look to diversify semiconductor supply chains. <b>Intel</b> may also fund investments by monetizing assets, including <span class="companylink">PSG</span> and IMS Nanofabrication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> faces intensified competition from rival, AMD, in both PCs and servers for DCs, as well as increasing utilization of custom ARM-based servers by cloud service provider customers. Nonetheless, <b>Intel</b>'s market share remains strong despite technology challenges and is poised to stabilize with new products set for production over the coming years, including those sourced from the company's increased use of third-party foundry, <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, for advanced products over the nearer term. From both an operating and financial profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> is weaker than 'AA-'-rated <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, given that company's significant leadership in leading edge foundry services, superior FCF profile and strong credit metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue down by mid-teens in 2023 followed by mid-single digit positive revenue growth in 2024, reflecting improved process technology and the resumption of positive PC unit shipment growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue grows by the mid- to high-single digits through the remainder of the forecast reflecting improving competitive positioning and modest growth in IFS;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margins strengthen to 50% in 2024 from the low 40% in 2023 before expanding to the mid- to high-50% through the remainder of the forecast period from a combination of positive revenue growth, benefits from <b>Intel</b>'s cost reduction initiatives and a richer sales mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating EBITDA margins expand from the mid-20% to the mid-40% through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending remains in the low- to mid-30s as a percentage of revenue with offsets from financial partners and government subsidies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> begins funding a portion of capex with net proceeds from divestitures, including <span class="companylink">PSG</span> in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat dividends and no stock buybacks;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities and plugs cash burn with a combination of divestitures, partnerships, government grants and incremental debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> regains a greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant growth in non-PC and DC segments resulting in greater revenue diversification, underscoring the company's technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations <b>Intel</b> will sustain EBITDA leverage near 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained negative organic revenue growth or expectations that <b>Intel</b> will not be able to sustain Fitch-adjusted gross profit margins above 50% due to a structurally weakened competitive position and product roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative FCF beyond 2025, underscoring failure in the company's technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.0x beyond the intermediate term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b>'s liquidity is pressured and, as of Dec. 30, 2023, was supported by $7.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $18.0 billion of short-term investments, an undrawn $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due March 2028 and undrawn $5.0 billion 364-day RCF expiring March 2024. The credit facilities fully back-stop <b>Intel</b>'s $10.0 billion CP program, under which no borrowings were outstanding at quarter-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will be negative over the next few years requiring a combination of contributions from financial partners, government subsidies or, potentially, debt financing to fund the company's investment super-cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp.</span> is the world's largest integrated design manufacturer, providing integrated circuits and related products into computing, internet of things and communications markets, in addition to providing foundry services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-05 October 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> believes that <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>.?s ?A-?/?F2? ratings and Negative Rating Outlook are unaffected by the company?s plan to begin operating its Programmable Solutions Group (<span class="companylink">PSG</span>) as a separate business unit beginning Jan. 1, 2024. <b>Intel</b> plans to bring private investors into the <span class="companylink">PSG</span> business in 2024 on a path to an initial public offering (IPO) over the next two to three years, with <b>Intel</b> retaining a majority stake in the entity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Net proceeds from the spin-off will partially offset Fitch?s forecast for significant negative intermediate-term FCF as <b>Intel</b> completes its investment super-cycle aimed at regaining manufacturing leadership and building out its foundry services business (<span class="companylink">IFS</span>) to capitalize on significant semiconductor market growth from increasing semiconductor content and supply chain regionalization. Offsets to capital investments, including financial partnerships, government incentives and monetizing assets, are likely insufficient to support cash needs over this horizon, requiring incremental debt funding and pressuring credit metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook will continue to focus on <b>Intel</b>?s ability to reverse market share losses by out-innovating competitors over the next 3-5 years and build a competitive foundry services business to take advantage of semiconductor supply chain regionalization while cutting operating expenses by $8 billion. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will monitor the company?s ability to achieve technology node transition targets and quality of adjusted gross margins, which will be volatile over the intermediate term with start-up costs related to multiple product overlaps weighing on improving average selling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The separation announcement follows recent steps <b>Intel</b> has taken to narrow its strategic focus, including completing the IPO of <span class="companylink">Mobileye</span>, investments by Bain Capital Special Situations and <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd</span>. into <b>Intel</b>?s IMS Nanofabrication business and selling the NAND business to <span class="companylink">SK Hynix</span>. These measures have combined to add roughly $12 billion of cash to <b>Intel</b>?s balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The <span class="companylink">PSG</span> business is comprised of <b>Intel</b>?s Agilex, Stratix and other field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) products. The separation will free <span class="companylink">PSG</span> to shift resources to fast growing and high profitability opportunities in automotive, industrial and aerospace and defense opportunities from its current focus on <b>Intel</b>?s datacenter (DC) solutions businesses, capabilities which the company acquired via its 2015 $16.7 billion acquisition of <span class="companylink">Altera Corp</span>. In comparison, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices, Inc</span>. paid $35 billion in early 2022, for PSG?s chief competitor and FPGA technology leader, <span class="companylink">Xilinx, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> estimates the FPGA market growing at a high-single digit rate to $11.5 billion by 2027 from $8 billion in 2023, with the company posting $2.9 billion of FPGA revenue for the latest 12 month (LTM) ended June 30, 2023 and representing roughly 5% of <b>Intel</b>?s consolidated revenue over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">PSG</span>, as part of <b>Intel</b>?s Data Center & Artificial Intelligence segment, does not break out standalone profit margins, but these are above corporate-wide averages. Over the longer-term, <b>Intel</b> guided to <span class="companylink">PSG</span> gross margins in the mid-60% and operating margins in the mid-30%, well above Fitch?s consolidated 2023 forecast of adjusted gross margin in the mid-40% and adjusted EBIT margin in the mid-single digits.</p>

                           Fitch Ratings: <b>Intel</b>’s Ratings and Outlook Unaffected by Dividend Cut Despite Lower FCF Burn</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-24 February 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> states that <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>.’s ‘A-’ ratings and Negative Rating Outlook are unaffected by the company’s dividend cut. Nonetheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that the resulting reduction of FCF burn and debt funding requirements could pull forward by roughly a year, the point at which <b>Intel</b> returns credit metrics back in-line with the current rating to 2025, decreasing the probability of further interim negative rating actions by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We remain focused on execution risk on <b>Intel</b>’s technology roadmap, which ambitiously calls for regaining technology leadership by virtue of achieving five technology node migrations over a four-year period and building a leading-edge foundry services business. <b>Intel</b>’s board cut the dividend by two-thirds to $0.125 per share and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the reduction will save the <b>Intel</b> roughly $3 billion in 2023 and reduce our forecast FCF usage to just over $12 billion, which <b>Intel</b> roughly funded by virtue of its recent $11 billion senior notes offering. This should result in available cash balances comfortably over $20 billion with full availability under the commercial paper program exiting 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >More importantly, the lower dividend should reduce the amount of incremental debt issuance required to plug negative FCF, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s forecast positions <b>Intel</b> to approach break-even FCF in the 2025-2026 timeframe and achieve EBITDA leverage of 2x in 2025. Our forecast assumes net capital spending to revenue of low-30%, absent any capital spending offsets from government support or financial partnerships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> also affirmed its guidance from its most recent earnings call and reiterated its commitment to delivering $3 billion of cost savings in 2023 and $8 billion-$10 billion in annualized savings by the end of 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects cost cuts will be an important element in returning operating EBITDA margins to the mid-40% range in the next few years from a Fitch-forecast 30% in 2023. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will focus on the company’s adjusted gross profit margin expansion from roughly 40% expected for 2023 toward mid-50% over the next three years as a key indicator of <b>Intel</b>’s progress along its technology roadmap, although improvement will be uneven given inefficiencies related to multiple overlapping product start-ups.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-07 February 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has rated <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>.'s (<b>Intel</b>) senior notes offering 'A-'. The senior notes will be pari passu with <b>Intel</b>'s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to refinancing of outstanding debt, funding for working capital and capital expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Intermediate-Term FCF: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF will be negative over the 2023-2025 period as <b>Intel</b> completes its investment super-cycle aimed at regaining manufacturing technology leadership and building out its foundry services business. Meanwhile, revenue and profitability will be down considerably in 2023, driven by record excess inventory following robust PC and server demand surrounding the pandemic-related policies. Profit margins will fall to record low levels in the near term before rebounding in 2024, with the resumption of positive revenue growth and flow-through of benefits from <b>Intel</b>'s $3 billion cost savings initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects cash balances to remain high in the $20 billion-$30 billion range; however, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to fund cash burn with a combination of contributions from financial partners, such as its JV with Brookfield Capital, government subsidies and tax benefits and, likely, incremental debt issuance. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the potential for higher debt levels and lower profitability in 2023 will drive credit metric deterioration and position the company in the low 'A' rating category. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts EBITDA leverage, estimated at 2.1x exiting 2022, will remain in the 2.0x-3.0x range over the 2023-2025 period, while CFO-Capex/Total Debt (adjusted for JV-minority partner contributions) will be negative to minimal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes higher investment intensity is structural rather than temporary given <b>Intel</b>'s commitment to regaining process technology leadership and building out <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. <b>Intel</b>'s success, which would enable it to stem or reverse market share losses and gain a meaningful foothold in the $100 billion foundry addressable market, rather than moderate spending levels, will determine the company's ability to remain in the 'A' rating category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is cautious on guidance for longer-term capital spending normalization, given that elevated spending levels are in line with technology leaders. <b>Intel</b>'s expanded outsourcing of advanced products manufacturing to <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> adds flexibility to the pace of investments and hedges against technology roadmap missteps. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes dynamics related to the development of a domestic semiconductor supply chain, including significant co-investments and government subsidies, reduces the likelihood of <b>Intel</b> pivoting on its strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual capital spending net of co-investments and subsidies of $15 billion-25 billion (low- to mid-30% of revenue), up from an average of $15 billion (20% of revenue) in the 2016-2020 period. R&D adds another $15+ billion in non-GAAP spending on innovation with potential moderation related to the company's recent restructuring program announcement, up from an average of $13 billion per year between 2016 and 2020. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> will pursue additional co-investments and subsidies to defray spending levels, potentially reducing the drag on FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s credit profile benefits from the company's still strong market positions in personal computers PC and DC, despite ongoing share erosion in servers to traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>., and ARM-based custom servers. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things (IoT) and automotive markets should offset share losses. In addition, new product technology introductions over the next several years should stabilize share and potentially reverse losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Tower Semiconductor Acquisition: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the proposed all-cash acquisition of <span class="companylink">Tower Semiconductor</span> for $5.4 billion will add specialty technologies on mature nodes to <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. Tower's expertise in radio frequency, power, silicon-germanium and industrial sensors and long-standing customer relationships strengthen <b>Intel</b>'s ability to address faster growing mobile, automotive and power end markets, while Tower's footprint adds two million wafer starts per year of capacity in the U.S. and Asia. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> use cash to fund the deal, which it expects to close in 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s weakened financial position within the context of its investment super-cycle and process technology disadvantage position it more in line with a low-'A' category rating. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects meaningfully negative FCF and weak leverage metrics over the intermediate term, which is inconsistent with the company previous strong 'A' rating. Beyond the intermediate term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects stronger profit margins and FCF; however, a return to historical levels will require strong execution across a number of <b>Intel</b>'s strategic initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case contemplates recovering end markets in 2024, aided by product refreshes that should stabilize market share while <b>Intel</b>'s restructuring actions support profit margin expansion. High cash balances, co-investments and government subsidies may be insufficient to support capital spending but these investments over the longer-term position <b>Intel</b> as a market leader with meaningful foundry services capabilities in the U.S. and Europe as customers look to diversify their foundry suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> faces intensified competition from rival, AMD, in both PCs and servers for DCs, as well as increasing utilization of custom ARM-based servers by service provider customers. Nonetheless, <b>Intel</b>'s market share remains strong despite technology challenges and is poised to stabilize with new products set for production over the coming years, including those sourced from the company's increased use of foundry partner, <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, for advanced products. From both an operating and financial profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> is weaker than <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, given that company's significant leadership in leading edge foundry services, superior FCF profile and strong credit metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 'F2' short-term and CP ratings reflect correspondence with <b>Intel</b>'s lower long-term ratings. Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Corporate Rating Criteria, an 'A-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) links to either an 'F1' or 'F2' Short-Term IDR with the Financial Flexibility factor of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Global Technology navigator with a particular focus on the Liquidity sub-factor. In <b>Intel</b>'s case, Liquidity will be challenged given the company's negative FCF over the rating horizon, yielding a 'bbb' sub-factor rating, as well as a 'bbb' overall Financial Flexibility factor rating, and corresponding to the baseline (F2) rather than higher (F1) Short-Term IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue down by mid-teens in 2023 reflecting weak demand conditions, excess inventory levels and market share losses in DC;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue begins recovering in 2024 and grows at high single digits through the remainder of the forecast reflecting improving competitive positioning and modest growth in IFS;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margins trough at 40%-45% in 2023 before expanding with the resumption of revenue growth, benefits from <b>Intel</b>'s cost reduction initiatives and a richer sales mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> achieves operating expense reduction targets and operating EBITDA margins trough at 31% in 2023 before returning to low 40% through the forecast period, given operating leverage in the model;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending remains in the low- to mid-30% as a percentage of revenue with offsets from financial partners and government subsidies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividend growth is modest and no share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> completes the <span class="companylink">Tower Semiconductor</span> acquisition in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities and plugs cash burn with incremental debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-<b>Intel</b> regains a greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant growth in non-PC and DC segments resulting in greater revenue diversification, underscoring the company's technology roadmap;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity: <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity as of Dec. 31, 2022 was supported by $11.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $17.2 billion of short-term investments, an undrawn $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due March 2027 and undrawn $5.0 billion 364-day RCF expiring November 2023. The credit facilities fully back-stop <b>Intel</b>'s $10.0 billion CP program, under which $3.9 billion was outstanding at quarter-end. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF, historically providing significant support for liquidity, will be significantly negative over the next few years requiring a combination of contributions from financial partners, government subsidies or, potentially, debt financing to support investment needs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-02 February 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings to 'A-' from 'A+', and Short-Term IDR and Commercial Paper Ratings to 'F2' from 'F1'. The Rating Outlook on <b>Intel</b>'s Long-Term IDR is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that structurally higher investment intensity as <b>Intel</b> seeks to regain technology leadership and build out its foundry services business amidst weak demand conditions and market share losses, will result in significant intermediate-term negative FCF. Offsets to capital investments, including financial partnerships and government incentives, are likely insufficient to support cash needs over this horizon, requiring incremental debt funding and pressuring credit metrics. Meanwhile, execution risk is considerable, given that <b>Intel</b> is cutting costs while investing to out-innovate competitors over the next three-to-five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Intermediate-Term FCF: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF will be negative over the 2023-2025 period as <b>Intel</b> completes its investment super-cycle aimed at regaining manufacturing technology leadership and building out its foundry services business. Meanwhile, revenue and profitability will be down considerably in 2023, driven by record excess inventory following robust PC and server demand surrounding the pandemic-related policies. Profit margins will fall to record low levels in the near term before rebounding in 2024, with the resumption of positive revenue growth and flow-through of benefits from <b>Intel</b>'s $3 billion cost savings initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects cash balances to remain high in the $20 billion-$30 billion range; however, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to fund cash burn with a combination of contributions from financial partners, such as its JV with Brookfield Capital, government subsidies and tax benefits and, likely, incremental debt issuance. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the potential for higher debt levels and lower profitability in 2023 will drive credit metric deterioration and position the company in the low 'A' rating category. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts EBITDA leverage, estimated at 2.1x exiting 2022, will remain in the 2.0x-3.0x range over the 2023-2025 period, while CFO-Capex/Total Debt (adjusted for JV-minority partner contributions) will be negative to minimal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes higher investment intensity is structural rather than temporary given <b>Intel</b>'s commitment to regaining process technology leadership and building out <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. <b>Intel</b>'s success, which would enable it to stem or reverse market share losses and gain a meaningful foothold in the $100 billion foundry addressable market, rather than moderate spending levels, will determine the company's ability to remain in the 'A' rating category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is cautious on guidance for longer-term capital spending normalization, given that elevated spending levels are in line with technology leaders. <b>Intel</b>'s expanded outsourcing of advanced products manufacturing to <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> adds flexibility to the pace of investments and hedges against technology roadmap missteps. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes dynamics related to the development of a domestic semiconductor supply chain, including significant co-investments and government subsidies, reduces the likelihood of <b>Intel</b> pivoting on its strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual capital spending net of co-investments and subsidies of $15 billion-25 billion (low- to mid-30% of revenue), up from an average of $15 billion (20% of revenue) in the 2016-2020 period. R&D adds another $15+ billion in non-GAAP spending on innovation with potential moderation related to the company's recent restructuring program announcement, up from an average of $13 billion per year between 2016 and 2020. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> will pursue additional co-investments and subsidies to defray spending levels, potentially reducing the drag on FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s credit profile benefits from the company's still strong market positions in personal computers PC and DC, despite ongoing share erosion in servers to traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>., and ARM-based custom servers. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things (IoT) and automotive markets should offset share losses. In addition, new product technology introductions over the next several years should stabilize share and potentially reverse losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Tower Semiconductor Acquisition: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the proposed all-cash acquisition of <span class="companylink">Tower Semiconductor</span> for $5.4 billion will add specialty technologies on mature nodes to <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. Tower's expertise in radio frequency, power, silicon-germanium and industrial sensors and long-standing customer relationships strengthen <b>Intel</b>'s ability to address faster growing mobile, automotive and power end markets, while Tower's footprint adds two million wafer starts per year of capacity in the U.S. and Asia. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> use cash to fund the deal, which it expects to close in 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s weakened financial position within the context of its investment super-cycle and process technology disadvantage position it more in line with a low-'A' category rating. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects meaningfully negative FCF and weak leverage metrics over the intermediate term, which is inconsistent with the company previous strong 'A' rating. Beyond the intermediate term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects stronger profit margins and FCF; however, a return to historical levels will require strong execution across a number of <b>Intel</b>'s strategic initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case contemplates recovering end markets in 2024, aided by product refreshes that should stabilize market share while <b>Intel</b>'s restructuring actions support profit margin expansion. Solid cash balances, co-investments and government subsidies should provide sufficient liquidity to fund capital spending, which over the longer-term positions <b>Intel</b> as a market leader with meaningful foundry services capabilities in the U.S. and Europe as customers look to diversify their foundry suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> faces intensified competition from rival, AMD, in both PCs and servers for DCs, as well as increasing utilization of custom ARM-based servers by service provider customers. Nonetheless, <b>Intel</b>'s market share remains strong despite technology challenges and is poised to stabilize with new products set for production over the coming years, including those sourced from the company's increased use of foundry partner, <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, for advanced products. From both an operating and financial profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> is weaker than <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, given that company's significant leadership in leading edge foundry services, superior FCF profile and strong credit metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 'F2' short-term and CP ratings reflect correspondence with <b>Intel</b>'s lower LT ratings. Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Corporate Rating Criteria, an 'A-' LT IDR links to either an 'F1' or 'F2' ST IDR with the Financial Flexibility factor of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Global Technology navigator with a particular focus on the Liquidity sub-factor. In <b>Intel</b>'s case, Liquidity will be challenged given the company's negative FCF over the rating horizon, yielding a 'bbb' sub-factor rating, as well as a 'bbb' overall Financial Flexibility factor rating, and corresponding to the baseline (F2) rather than higher (F1) ST IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue down by mid-teens in 2023 reflecting weak demand conditions, excess inventory levels and market share losses in DC;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue begins recovering in 2024 and grows at high single digits through the remainder of the forecast reflecting improving competitive positioning and modest growth in IFS;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margins trough at 40%-45% in 2023 before expanding with the resumption of revenue growth, benefits from <b>Intel</b>'s cost reduction initiatives and a richer sales mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> achieves operating expense reduction targets and operating EBITDA margins trough at 31% in 2023 before returning to low 40% through the forecast period, given operating leverage in the model;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending remains in the low- to mid-30% as a percentage of revenue with offsets from financial partners and government subsidies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividend growth is modest and no share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> completes the <span class="companylink">Tower Semiconductor</span> acquisition in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities and plugs cash burn with incremental debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> regains a greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant growth in non-PC and DC segments resulting in greater revenue diversification, underscoring the company's technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations <b>Intel</b> will sustain EBITDA leverage near 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained negative organic revenue growth or non-GAAP gross profit margins in the 40% range due to a structurally weakened competitive position and product roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative FCF beyond 2025, underscoring failure in the company's technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for EBITDA leverage sustained above 2.0x beyond the intermediate term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Modest liquidity: <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity is modest and, as of Dec. 31, 2022, was supported by $11.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $17.2 billion of short-term investments, an undrawn $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due March 2027 and undrawn $5.0 billion 364-day RCF expiring November 2023. The credit facilities fully back-stop <b>Intel</b>'s $10.0 billion CP program, under which $3.9 billion was outstanding at quarter-end. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF, historically providing significant support for liquidity, will be significantly negative over the next few years requiring a combination of contributions from financial partners, government subsidies or, potentially, debt financing to support investment needs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-16 November 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'A+' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings and 'F1' short-term ratings for <b>Intel</b> Corp. Fitch has withdrawn the ratings for <span class="companylink">Altera Corp</span>. The Rating Outlook is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect expectations for FCF usage and weak credit metrics as <b>Intel</b> invests to regain technology leadership and build-out its foundry services business (<span class="companylink">IFS</span>), which <b>Intel</b> will partially fund with co-investments. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will attribute to <b>Intel</b>'s debt quantum the net capital contributions from its joint venture (JV) partner, Brookfield Capital, adding up to $15 billion of debt over the capital contribution period, although back-end loaded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Share erosion and excess inventory amidst weakening near-term demand will weigh on results and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts EBITDA leverage will exceed our 1.5x negative rating sensitivity for 2022-2023. Solid revenue recovery and profit margin expansion will be necessary to bring FCF and credit metrics back in-line with the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has withdrawn the ratings for <span class="companylink">Altera</span> following the settlement of its lone tranche of senior unsecured notes, assumed by <b>Intel</b> in the 2015 acquisition. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not anticipate future debt issuance from the <span class="companylink">Altera Corp</span>. subsidiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >JV Treatment: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will attribute to <b>Intel</b>'s debt quantum the net capital contributions from its JV partner since the subsequent distributions to <span class="companylink">Brookfield</span> are debt-like in that they are subject to a fixed minimum and continue until the partner's ownership stake is fully depleted. A wafer purchase agreement (WPA) between <b>Intel</b> and the JV will fund distributions to the minority partner beginning after the capital contribution period. However, these distributions are mandatory whether or not the JV is able to supply the contracted wafers, a not inconsequential risk given <b>Intel</b>'s aim of achieving yields at five production nodes over the next four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As majority owner of the JV, <b>Intel</b> will consolidate the JV from a reporting standpoint and, mechanically, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects to add to <b>Intel</b>'s debt quantum the capital contributions from the minority partner. As production starts, distributions to the minority partner will reduce debt <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> attributes to <b>Intel</b>. Capital contributions from both <b>Intel</b> and the minority should be back-end loaded, since the majority of the project cost will be related to equipment purchases not made until the building shell is completed. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will assess disclosure once contributions commence and may use estimates if public disclosure is inadequate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes higher investment intensity is structural rather than temporary given <b>Intel</b>'s commitment to regaining process technology leadership and building out <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. <b>Intel</b>'s success, which would enable it to stem or reverse market share losses and gain a meaningful foothold in the $100 billion foundry addressable market, rather than moderate spending levels, will determine the company's ability to sustain a solid 'A' category credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is cautious on guidance for longer-term capital spending normalization given that elevated spending levels are in-line with technology leader. <b>Intel</b>'s expanded outsourcing of advanced products manufacturing to <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> adds flexibility to the pace of investments and hedges against technology roadmap missteps. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes dynamics related to the development of a domestic semiconductor supply chain, including significant co-investments and government subsidies, reduces the likelihood of <b>Intel</b> pivoting on its strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual capital spending net of co-investments and subsidies of $20 billion-25 billion (35%-40% of revenue), up from an average of $15 billion (20% of revenue) in the 2016-2020 period. R&D adds another $15+ billion in non-GAAP spending on innovation with potential moderation related to the company's recent restructuring program announcement, up from an average of $13 billion per year between 2016 and 2020. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b> will pursue additional co-investments and subsidies to defray spending levels, potentially reducing the drag on FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Liquidity remains adequate despite expectations for negative FCF over the medium-run, given elevated cash balances that are largely the result of paused share repurchases and net proceeds from divestitures. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that <b>Intel</b> may hold higher than historical cash levels and, therefore, excess available cash may be insufficient to offset negative FCF, potentially resulting in incremental debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s credit profile benefits from the company's still strong market positions in personal computers (PC) and data centers (DC), despite share ongoing erosion to traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>., and ARM-based custom servers for CSPs. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things (IoT) and automotive markets should offset share losses in rapidly growing DC service provider markets. In addition, new product technology introductions over the next few years should stabilize share and potentially reverse losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Tower Semiconductor Acquisition: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the proposed all-cash acquisition of <span class="companylink">Tower Semiconductor</span> for $5.4 billion will add specialty technologies on mature nodes to <span class="companylink">IFS</span>. Tower's expertise in radio frequency (RF), power, silicon-germanium (SiGe) and industrial sensors, as well as the company's long-standing customer relationships, strengthen <b>Intel</b>'s ability to address faster growing mobile, automotive and power end markets, while Tower's footprint adds two million wafer starts per year of capacity in the U.S. and Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company will use available cash to fund the transaction, which the company expects to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including the approval of Tower's stockholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s position for the rating has weakened, driven by an elevated investment cycle that will pressure FCF and credit metrics over the intermediate term. Risks associated with the company's ability to regain technology leadership and build out its foundry services businesses amidst weakening demand conditions and share losses will weigh on near-term revenue and profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case contemplates recovering end markets in 2024, aided by product refreshes that should stabilize market share while <b>Intel</b>'s restructuring actions support profit margin expansion. Solid cash balances, co-investments and government subsidies should provide sufficient liquidity to fund capital spending, which over the longer-term positions as a market leader with meaningful foundry services capabilities in the U.S. and Europe as customers look to diversify semiconductor supply chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b> faces intensified competition from rival, AMD, in both PCs and servers for DCs, as well as increasing utilization of custom ARM-based servers by cloud service provider customers. Nonetheless, <b>Intel</b>'s market share remains strong despite technology challenges and is poised to stabilize with new products set for production over the coming years, including those sourced from the company's increased use of third-party foundry, <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, for advanced products over the nearer-term. From both an operating and financial profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> is weaker than 'AA-'-rated <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, given that company's significant leadership in leading edge foundry services, superior FCF profile and strong credit metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue declines by high single digits in the current quarter from excess inventory resulting in revenue down 20% year-over-year for 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue down in the high single digits in 2023, driven by weaker end market demand as the supply chain works through excess PC and server inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single digit recovery across all end markets in 2024 and low- to mid-single digit revenue growth thereafter, driven by sustainable long-term demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted gross profit margins of 47.5% for 2022 and an increasing to 50% in 2023 and expanding considerably thereafter from product refreshes to 55%-60% through the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> achieves $3 billion of opex-focused run rate cost reductions in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$21 billion of capital spending, net of co-investments and subsidies, in 2023 and 2024 and 25% of revenue over the longer term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends grow by low-single digits and no share repurchases, while debt maturities are refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> regains a greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant growth in non-PC and datacenter segments resulting in greater revenue diversification, underscoring the company's technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could stabilize the ratings if we expect <b>Intel</b> to sustain EBITDA leverage below 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP gross profit margins sustained in the low- to mid-50% range due to meaningful DC market share erosion or significantly higher outsourcing rates;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative organic revenue growth or sustained negative FCF, underscoring failure in <b>Intel</b>'s technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt/operating EBITDA sustained above 1.5x from shareholder returns or significant profit margin degradation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate liquidity: <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity is adequate and, as of Oct. 1, 2022, was supported by $4.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $18.0 billion of short-term investments and an undrawn $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due March 2027. The RCF partially backstops the company's $10.0 billion CP program, under which no borrowings were outstanding at quarter-end. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF, historically providing significant support for liquidity, will be a drain on liquidity through the forecast period, although government subsidies and the company's co-investment strategy should partially offset elevated capital spending requirements.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-02 August 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned an 'A+' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span>'s senior notes offering, which will include a green bond offering. The senior notes will be pari passu with <b>Intel</b>'s existing senior unsecured debt. The company will use net proceeds from the senior notes, other than from the green bond offering, for general corporate purposes, including refinancing outstanding debt, funding for working capital, and capital expenditures. The company will use net proceeds from the green bond offering to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, one or more eligible projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <b>Intel</b>'s weaker than expected financial performance driven by competitive pressures and execution issues on top of sharper than anticipated declines in personal computer (PC) and server shipments. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts FCF (which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> measures after the company's roughly $6 billion dividend) of negative $7 billion-$8 billion, after <b>Intel</b> curtailed its budget for 2022 capacity additions. Lower utilization rates should weigh on profitability resulting in leverage metrics approaching <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s negative rating sensitivity (greater than 1.5x) for 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Manufacturing Strategy Pivot: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s manufacturing strategy pivot, which expands outsourcing of advanced products to <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> while investing to regain process technology leadership and build IFS, is credit neutral to positive, versus managing decline by abandoning technology leadership. However, it also significantly elevates execution risk, given <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>'s process node leadership, and that building a successful foundry business will only pay dividends over the longer term. Meanwhile, expanding outsourcing will weigh on profit margins even if it stabilizes share at leading edge nodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity to remain solid, despite break-even to negative FCF from meaningfully higher capital spending forecasted over at least the medium term. The company has considerable cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments that have been bolstered by net proceeds from <b>Intel</b>'s sale of its memory business, providing strong liquidity to support investments and upcoming debt maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s higher investment intensity is structural rather than temporary, should the company remain committed to process technology leadership and building its foundry services business. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts annual capital spending representing 35%-40% of revenue versus closer to 20% in more recent years. R&D should add another $15+ billion in non-GAAP spending on innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This higher level of spending is in line with technology leader, <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd</span>., which provides foundry services to <b>Intel</b>'s competitors, including <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. and custom solutions designed by large public cloud providers. However, <b>Intel</b>'s expanded outsourcing of advanced products manufacturing to <span class="companylink">TSMC</span> adds flexibility to the pace of investments and hedges against technology roadmap missteps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology-Driven Share Losses: <b>Intel</b>'s process technology transition challenges over the past several years have eroded the company's long-standing technology leadership and threatened <b>Intel</b>'s dominant market share and premium profit margins. It stands to lose considerable share to <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>., <b>Intel</b>'s long-time competitor with historically minimal share, and has hastened the long-anticipated adoption of ARM-based servers as large cloud providers foster an innovative ecosystem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: Still strong market positions in personal computers (PC) and datacenters (DC) support <b>Intel</b>'s ability to intensify investments in response to expected share erosion at the hands of traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. and ARM-based servers. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things (IoT) and automotive markets should, in conjunction with the resumption of higher mix enterprise and government infrastructure spending, offset share losses in rapidly growing DC service provider markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b> is in line with, but at the lower end, of the current rating. Its financial profile remains solid with strengthened liquidity; however, FCF will weaken under the weight of higher investment intensity as the company invests to close <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>'s process technology lead and build out <b>Intel</b>'s foundry services business. Still, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to sustain leverage under our negative sensitivity, which is total debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >From an operating profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> faces share erosion in DC and PCs but maintains very strong market positions at nearly 75%-80% share in markets that continue solid revenue growth. Ultimately, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <b>Intel</b>'s hybrid manufacturing model will enable the company to either solidify share by virtue of closing <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>'s technology leadership, or should <b>Intel</b> fail to close the technology gap, running significant volumes of advanced products through its foundry partner's manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes, from a financial perspective, <b>Intel</b> is roughly in line with <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, given <b>Intel</b>'s comparable profit margins and low EBITDA- and FFO-based leverage metrics. From an operating profile perspective, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also believes <b>Intel</b> stacks-up with <span class="companylink">TSMC</span>, given the latter's technology leadership and dominant foundry position offset by <b>Intel</b>'s greater flexibility in its prospective hybrid manufacturing model and unique footprint across regions, as demand for supply chain diversification remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue down by 15% due to sharper than expected decline in PC and DC server shipments, execution issues and market share losses;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue declines again in 2023 due to macro headwinds before returning to growth in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Profit margins down to the low-50% driven by underutilization and lower revenue levels followed by return to more normalized profit margins in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex reduced to $23 billion ($28 billion less government subsidies and other offsets);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends grow 5% annually;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No M&A or stock buybacks and debt maturities are refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> regains a greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant growth in non-PC and datacenter segments resulting in greater revenue diversification, underscoring the company's technology roadmap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP gross profit margins sustained in the low- to mid-50% range due to meaningful DC market share erosion or significantly higher outsourcing rates;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative organic revenue growth or sustained negative FCF, underscoring failure in <b>Intel</b>'s technology roadmap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt/operating EBITDA sustained above 1.5x from shareholder returns or significant profit margin degradation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid liquidity: <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity should remain solid through the forecast, and as of July 2,2022, was supported by $4.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $22.7 billion of short-term investments and an undrawn $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due March2027. The RCF partially backstops the company's $10.0 billion CP program, under which no borrowings were outstanding at quarter-end. <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will be negative over the next 2-3 years, which partnerships and government subsidies should partially offset.</p>

                     <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. is the world's largest integrated design manufacturer, providing integrated circuits and related products into computing, internet of things and communications markets, in addition to providing foundry services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-22 November 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecured ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span> at 'A+' and 'F1', respectively, and the Long-Term IDR and senior unsecured ratings for wholly owned subsidiary, <span class="companylink">Altera Corp</span>., at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for solid operating and financial performance, despite anticipated share losses and challenged FCF over the next 2-3 years as <b>Intel</b> pivots from capital returns to investing in innovation and building a foundry business. Organic revenue growth will remain positive and profit margins strong for the rating, despite lower gross profit margins over the medium term as the company ramps new process technologies. Through the company's manufacturing strategy pivot, <b>Intel</b> will benefit from strong liquidity and headroom under Fitch's negative leverage sensitivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Manufacturing Strategy Pivot: Fitch believes <b>Intel</b>'s manufacturing strategy pivot, which expands outsourcing of advanced products to TSMC while investing to regain process technology leadership and build IFS, is credit neutral to positive, versus managing decline by abandoning technology leadership. However, it also significantly elevates execution risk, given TSMC's process node leadership and that building a successful foundry business will only pay dividends over the longer term. Meanwhile, expanding outsourcing will weigh on profit margins even if it stabilizes share at leading edge nodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity to remain solid, despite break-even to negative FCF from meaningfully higher capital spending forecasted over at least the medium term. The company has considerable cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trading assets that will be bolstered by net proceeds from <b>Intel</b>'s sale of its memory business, providing strong liquidity to support investments and upcoming debt maturities should <b>Intel</b> fall short of forecasts. Additionally, Fitch expects <b>Intel</b> will use FCF formerly designated for stock buybacks to fund the uptick in capex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally Higher Investment Intensity: Fitch believes <b>Intel</b>'s higher investment intensity is structural rather than temporary, should the company remain committed to process technology leadership and building its foundry services business. Fitch forecasts capital spending, net of government subsidies, of $25 billion-$30 billion through the forecast period, representing 35%-40% of revenue versus closer to 20% in more recent years. R&D should add another $15+ billion in non-GAAP spending on innovation, bringing total investment intensity to nearly 60% of revenue, versus 40%-45% historically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This higher level of spending is in-line with technology leader, <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd</span>., which provides foundry services to <b>Intel</b>'s competitors, including <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. and custom solutions designed by large public cloud providers. However, <b>Intel</b>'s expanded outsourcing of advanced products manufacturing to TSMC adds flexibility to the pace of investments and hedges against technology roadmap missteps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology-Driven Share Losses: <b>Intel</b>'s process technology transition challenges over the past several years have eroded the company's long-standing technology leadership and threatened <b>Intel</b>'s dominant market share and premium profit margins. It stands to lose considerable share to <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>., <b>Intel</b>'s long-time competitor with historically minimal share, and has hastened the long-anticipated adoption of ARM-based servers as large cloud providers foster an innovative ecosystem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Market Positions: Still strong market positions in personal computers (PC) and data centers (DC) support <b>Intel</b>'s ability to intensify investments in response to expected share erosion at the hands of traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. and ARM-based servers. Strong growth in PCs, communications service providers, internet of things (IoT) and automotive markets should, in conjunction with the resumption of higher mix enterprise and government infrastructure spending, offset share losses in rapidly growing DC service provider markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify, as service providers consolidate IT spending, potentially resulting in more volatile quarterly results. The largest hyperscale cloud companies will continue robust DC capacity deployments, driven by increasing demand for computing and storage of data growth and ongoing workload migration to public clouds. Large telecom service providers will also continue deploying capacity as data proliferates exponentially at the edge, although longer term growth in IoT and ADAS should mitigate some customer concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <b>Intel</b> is positioned in-line but at the lower end of the current rating. Its financial profile remains solid with strengthened liquidity but FCF will weaken under the weight of higher investment intensity as the company invests to close TSMC's process technology lead and build out <b>Intel</b>'s foundry services business. Still, the company has headroom under Fitch's negative leverage sensitivity, which is total debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x. Furthermore, cash flow that previously was returned to shareholders will fund the incremental capital spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >From an operating profile perspective, <b>Intel</b> faces share erosion in DC and PCs but maintains very strong market positions at nearly 75%-80% share in markets that continue solid revenue growth. Ultimately, Fitch believes <b>Intel</b>'s hybrid manufacturing model will enable the company to either solidify share by virtue of closing TSMC's technology leadership or, should <b>Intel</b> fail to close the technology gap, running significant volumes of advanced products through its foundry partner's manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes, from a financial perspective, <b>Intel</b> is roughly in-line with TSMC, given <b>Intel</b>'s comparable profit margins and low EBITDA- and FFO-based leverage metrics. From an operating profile perspective, Fitch also believes <b>Intel</b> stacks-up in-line with TSMC, given the latter's technology leadership and dominant foundry position offset by <b>Intel</b>'s greater flexibility in its prospective hybrid manufacturing model and unique footprint across regions as demand for supply chain diversification remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modest revenue growth, excluding the impacts of divestitures, in 2021 and 2022, followed by excess capacity and a customer digestion-driven mid-single digit correction in 2023 before resuming low-single digit revenue growth in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margin remains in the low-50% through the forecast as the company ramps process nodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Spending remains roughly flat with non-GAAP R&D near 21% of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex is $25 billion-$30 billion annually, representing 35%-40% of revenue through the forecast period, as <b>Intel</b> invests in closing TSMC's technology-leadership gap and building <b>Intel</b>'s foundry services business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends grow by low-single digits annually and no significant stock buybacks with FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities to maintain total debt/operating EBITDA close to 1.0x but certainly below 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> regains a greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant growth in non-CSG and -DCG segments resulting in greater revenue diversification, underscoring the company's technology roadmap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP gross profit margins sustained in the low- to mid-50% range due to meaningful DC market share erosion or significantly higher outsourcing rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative organic revenue growth or sustained negative FCF, underscoring failure in <b>Intel</b>'s technology roadmap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt/operating EBITDA sustained above 1.5x from shareholder returns or significant profit margin degradation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity will remain solid through the forecast and, as of Sept. 25, 2021, was supported by $7.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $4.0 billion of short-term investments and an undrawn $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) due March 2026. The RCF partially backstops the company's $10.0 billion CP program, under which no borrowings were outstanding at quarter-end. <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF, which has been $5.0 billion-$10.0 billion in recent years, will be break-even to negative over the next 2-3 years with CFO absorbed by incremental capital spending and the dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additional sources of liquidity include portions of <b>Intel</b>'s $22.8 billion of trading assets at Sept. 25, 2021 and anticipated net proceeds from the sale of <b>Intel</b>'s memory business to <span class="companylink">SK Hynix</span>, which will gross <b>Intel</b> $7.0 billion shortly after deal close and $2.0 billion in 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. is the world's largest integrated design manufacturer, providing integrated circuits and related products into computing, internet of things and communications markets, in addition to providing foundry services.</p>

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-28 October 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> maintains the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) for the 'A-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and the senior unsecured debt for <span class="companylink">Xilinx Inc</span>. The ratings reflect the company's pending merger with <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices, Inc</span>. (AMD), which remains under review by Chinese regulators and is now not expected to close until the end of calendar 2021. At or near deal close, Fitch expects to resolve the RWN by affirming the ratings at 'A-' or downgrading them by one notch to 'BBB+', depending upon the ultimate guarantee structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The current rating reflects Fitch's expectation for the continuation of solid operating performance on a standalone basis, driven by technology leadership, resulting in strong market positions in a well-diversified set of secular growth end-markets. Near-term demand should remain solid, given recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and meaningful fiscal and monetary intervention, while supply shortages flatten but extend elevated revenue growth. Amidst this backdrop, profit and cash flow margins will remain healthier than previously forecast and support <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s solid financial profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pending Merger with AMD: Fitch expects the merger to expand addressable markets, diversify products and support R&D scale. The deal roughly replicates <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>.'s December 2015 acquisition of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) competitor, <span class="companylink">Altera Corp</span>., but with technology leadership for the AMD-<span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> combination. AMD's share gains in DC, notebooks and discrete graphics processors have been rapid, but primary competitors, <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b></span> and <span class="companylink">NVIDIA Corp</span>., continue to benefit from meaningfully higher starting market share and stronger financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b></span>'s financial flexibility will be tested as it embarks on a heavy investment cycle to close AMD's process technology leadership, but is hedging its bet by outsourcing next-generation products to the same foundry AMD uses, potentially eradicating AMD's process advantage in a few years. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> remains the clear technology leader in graphics processors for parallel processing for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, a position that an ultimately successful acquisition by NVIDIA of ARM Holdings, plc. would only fortify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology Leadership: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> will leverage its long-time leadership in programmable logic technology to expand addressable markets. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s leadership in 28-nanometer (nm) and 16nm systems-on-a-chip drives strong adoption across end markets, particularly for 5G deployment in wireless and DC. Its next-generation 7nm-based adaptive compute acceleration platforms (ACAP) are positioned to drive future growth, given secular demand for computing, storage and networking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Moderating Profit Margins: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s profit margins will remain solid but be constrained by strong growth in less profitable wireless communications and core broadcast, consumer and automotive markets. However, <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> has maintained non-GAAP gross profit margins near record levels, despite headwinds from inflationary input costs and a challenging global trade environment. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> will partially offset margin pressure with sustained revenue growth and robust adoption of ACAP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Significant Technology Risk: Fitch expects heightened competitive intensity as <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> continues pushing further into the semiconductor industry's most attractive growth markets, including DC, automotive, industrial and 5G markets. Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> competitors <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b></span> will leverage their greater financial flexibility to maintain aggressive investment levels, and significant custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) development will sustain displacement risk. As a result, Xilinx's R&D should remain above 20% of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Meaningful Revenue Diversification: Fitch expects significant product, end-market and geographic diversification will continue to moderate cyclicality. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s design wins for 5G deployments and long-cycle aerospace and defense should offset weak demand in more macroeconomic-sensitive end markets in fiscal 2021, along with hyperscale DC spending. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s low-inventory obsolescence risk due to product adaptability also reduces cyclicality. Fitch anticipates <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s focus on DC growth should modestly increase customer concentration from current levels (top-20 customers are 40% of revenue).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s 'A-' IDR reflects strong intellectual property (IP) in diversified secular growth markets, solid profit margins and FCF conversion. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> compares less favorably with peers <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b></span> (A+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> (Not Rated) due to their superior financial flexibility, despite a pandemic-induced uptick in both companies' leverage. <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b></span>'s very strong market positions in CPUs for personal computers and DC servers drives significant annual FCF, despite the company's significant annual capital spending leading to higher absolute FCF but lower FCF margins than <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth in the mid-teens in fiscal 2022, driven by solid recovery in cyclical markets, a resumption of DC spending and a multi-year 5G investment cycle, despite chip shortages;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low-single-digit in fiscal 2023 as a correction in the second half of the fiscal year offsets continued strength into the first;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Moderate profit margin contraction from a growing mix of lower gross profit margin revenue, offset by modest operating expense growth resulting in operating EBITDA margins in the mid- to high-30% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> refinances upcoming debt maturities and maintains total debt/operating EBITDA below 2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF will largely be added to the balance sheet in fiscal 2021 but would otherwise be used for tuck-in acquisitions and capital returns on a standalone basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade (were the merger agreement to be terminated):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Commitment to maintain total debt/operating EBITDA below 1.5x and total debt/FCF below 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Evidence supporting <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s platform leadership slowing displacement by ASICs, including share gains in DC, or operating EBITDA margins sustained near 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade (were the merger agreement to be terminated):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt/operating EBITDA sustained above 2x or total debt/FCF above 3x due to structurally weaker than anticipated operating performance, serial acquisitions or intensified shareholder returns;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Evidence that <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s platforms are insufficient to stem the pace of ASICs' displacement or market share losses, or operating EBITDA margins sustained near 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s liquidity will remain solid, and, as of Oct. 2, 2021, was supported by $3.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Fitch's expectation for $500 million to $1 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity. On Dec. 1, 2020, <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> terminated its $400 million RCF set to expire in December 2021, instead relying on available cash build as the result of the company's suspension of share repurchases in anticipation of the merger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. For more information on Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores, visit www.fitchratings.com/esg[http://www.fitchratings.com/esg].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Xilinx, Inc</span>. is the leading provider of FPGA, programmable systems-on-a-chip and ACAP with $3.5 billion of annual revenue and more than 50% market share in FPGAs. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> drives innovation across a variety of end markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-10 August 2021: Fitch has rated <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span>'s senior notes offering 'A+'. The senior notes will be pari passu with <b>Intel</b>'s existing senior unsecured debt. The company will use net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt, funding for working capital and capital expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <b>Intel</b>'s solid financial profile and financial flexibility, despite expectations for technology-led data center (DC) market share erosion and intensifying investment requirements associated with <b>Intel</b>'s hybrid manufacturing strategy. Robust demand exiting the COVID-19 pandemic in combination with continued supply constraints will support revenue growth through at least the near-term. A higher mix of personal computer (PC) sales will weigh on gross margins, although expectations for a resumption of enterprise and government servers should moderate margin compression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects lower than historical FCF and FCF margins as <b>Intel</b> accelerates process technology development while adding significant capacity to meet expected internal and foundry customer demand. Fitch expects more than $5 billion of annual FCF and FCF margins in the mid-single digits through the forecast period, down from $15 billion and nearly 20% in 2020, respectively. although subsidies could offset investments as the U.S. governments seeks to incentivize the build-out of U.S.-based manufacturing capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology-Driven Share Losses: <b>Intel</b>'s process technology transition challenges over the past several years have eroded the company's long-standing technology leadership and threatened <b>Intel</b>'s dominant market share and premium profit margins. It stands to lose considerable share to <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>., <b>Intel</b>'s long-time competitor with historically minimal share, and has hastened the long-anticipated adoption of ARM-based servers as ever more sophisticated customers seek to drive market innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Manufacturing Strategy Risk: Fitch believes <b>Intel</b>'s manufacturing strategy, which will increase outsourcing of manufacturing to current technology leader. <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co</span>., and invest to accelerate internal process technology development and reboot its foundry services, elevates risk. Outsourcing will compress profit margins. At the same time, investment requirements for internal development and capacity additions will intensify with no certainty that <b>Intel</b> will close the technology gap with TSMC or attract sufficient foundry customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Still Strong Market Positions: Still strong market positions in personal computers (PC) and data centers (DC) support <b>Intel</b>'s ability to intensify investments in response to expected share erosion at the hands of traditional competitor, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. and ARM-based servers. Strong growth in PCs, internet of things (IoT) and Mobileye's automotive solutions should, in aggregate, mostly offset share losses in rapidly growing cloud DC markets, although the resumption of higher mix enterprise and government hardware spending anticipated for 2H21 will slow <b>Intel</b>'s pace of DC revenue headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Financial Flexibility: <b>Intel</b>'s financial flexibility remains solid despite Fitch's expectation for annual FCF to range from $5 billion-$10 billion over the forecast, down from $10 billion-$15 billion in recent years. Margin pressure in addition to higher investment intensity will drive FCF margins lower, although the company may benefit from government support as <b>Intel</b> builds-out its foundry business, thereby expanding manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and, potentially, Europe. Meanwhile, Fitch expects <b>Intel</b> to continue shifting long-time focus from stock buybacks to organic investments, supporting financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Investment Intensity: R&D and capital spending will remain significant and should intensify as <b>Intel</b> accelerates its process technology development cadence to catch leaders and builds out foundry capabilities. With expectations for only modest average revenue growth over the medium term, Fitch forecasts capex and research and development approaching 45% of revenue beginning this year, up from just over 35% in 2020. Slowing Moore's Law has raised investment intensity for the semiconductor industry, a phenomenon that will only been exacerbated by calls for diversifying supply chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify, as service providers consolidate IT spending, potentially resulting in more volatile quarterly results. The largest hyperscale cloud companies will continue robust DC capacity deployments, driven by increasing demand for computing and storage of data growth and ongoing workload migration to public clouds. Large telecom service providers will also continue deploying capacity as data proliferates exponentially at the edge, although longer term growth in IoT and ADAS should mitigate some customer concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <b>Intel</b> is positioned at the lower end of the current rating with its financial profile still solid but likely weakening under the weight of higher investment intensity amid top line headwinds from share losses in the company's second largest and most profitable segment, Data Center Group (DCG). Process technology delays in recent years have opened the door to for share losses to legacy competitor, AMD and ARM-based servers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b>'s strategy pivot will include outsourcing leading-edge manufacturing to TSMC, likely reducing AMD's current process technology advantage while at the same time weighing on <b>Intel</b>'s gross profit margins (currently in the mid- to high-50% range on a non-GAAP basis). Fitch expects long-term term convergence with rivals' considerably lower gross margins until <b>Intel</b> regains process technology leadership internally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Meanwhile, FCF and FCF margins will contract due to significantly higher capital spending, aimed at developing leading edge process technology and adding capacity to meet robust demand and build-out its foundry services business. Cash flow should be sufficient should <b>Intel</b> continue to emphasize internal investments in lieu of share repurchases now that the company completed its $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program commenced in 2020. Net proceeds from the pending $9 billion sale of its memory and storage business to <span class="companylink">SK hynix</span> should also support flexibility for investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Slightly positive revenue growth in 2021-2022 driven by strong demand and supply constraints in PCs and solid IoT and automotive adoption, offset by negative mid-single digit DCG growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Resumption of flat to low-single-digit revenue growth in 2023-2024 as <b>Intel</b> ramps leading edge products at TSMC and progresses in strengthening its internal capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margin remains in the mid-50% range through the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex expands to 25% of revenue, absent any prospective government subsidies) to support capacity additions and build-out of foundry services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends grow by low single digits annually;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash flow primarily used for organic investments with only modest stock buybacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Net proceeds from the $7 billion cash payment upon closing the sale of its memory and storage business to <span class="companylink">SK hynix</span> to support liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities to maintain total debt/operating EBITDA below 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> maintains its greater than 80% share in DC markets while maintaining profit margins in line with industry peers, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Solid adoption of <b>Intel</b>'s IoT, PSG and Mobileye platforms, resulting in these businesses representing half of all non-Computing Solutions Group revenue in aggregate, underscoring the company's technology roadmap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Non-GAAP gross profit margins sustained in the low- to mid-50% range, driven by meaningful DC market share erosion or significantly higher outsourcing rates;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG or weaker than anticipated contribution from <b>Intel</b>'s IoT and automotive platforms;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total debt/operating EBITDA and to FCF sustained above 1.5x the mid-single digits from intensified shareholder returns or meaningfully weaker than expected operating performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity will remain solid through the forecast and, as of June 26, 2021, was supported by $7.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and Fitch's expectation for more than $5.0-$10.0 billion of annual FCF. In 1Q21, <b>Intel</b> entered into a $5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) maturing in March 2026 that backstops a portion of the CP program, under which the company is authorized to borrow up to $10 billion. As of June 26, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the CP program or RCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Over the nearer term, <b>Intel</b>'s pending sale of its memory and storage business to memory maker, <span class="companylink">SK hynix</span> Inc. for $9 billion will support liquidity as the company pivots toward investing in the reinvigoration of its manufacturing capabilities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-25 March 2021: The ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. are unaffected by the company's manufacturing strategy update, according to <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. Fitch believes <b>Intel</b>'s long-term commitment to manufacturing the majority of its products in-house while expanding the use of foundries for leading edge processors should enable it to moderate the pace of share and profit margin erosion over the next few years. In the update, <b>Intel</b> affirmed 2021 annual guidance, but Fitch expects heightened execution risk and weaker longer-term cash flow from increased investment intensity associated with <b>Intel</b>'s foundry services (FS) provider ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Intel</b>'s management has stated that it remains on-track to ship 7-nanometer (nm) lithography products in 2023. However, Fitch anticipates the company will expand outsourced processor manufacturing for advanced geometries until it closes the current technology gap with leading foundry, <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd</span>. (TSMC), which is already developing 5nm- and 3-nm processes. Fitch believes supply chain shortages, ranging from substrates to foundry supply, will limit <b>Intel</b>'s top line despite the strong demand environment and constrain its access to leading edge capacity at TSMC until at least 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Overall revenue growth should be roughly flat in 2021 (excluding the anticipated sale of the memory business), following two consecutive years of record revenue and cash flow. Fitch forecasts solid near-term revenue growth for <b>Intel</b>'s personal computer (PC) businesses with work/learn-from-home and consumer strength driving demand but share losses in datacenter (DC) markets that should persist through the intermediate term. Meanwhile, the lower sales mix should pressure gross profit margins, which <b>Intel</b> has lowered its guidance for to 56.5%, just above Fitch's mid-50% negative rating sensitivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >During the update, <b>Intel</b> also announced a plan to aggressively re-establish its foundry business and sketched out partnerships with the broader semiconductor ecosystem, including <span class="companylink">International Business Machines Corp</span>.'s semiconductor business, service providers and foundries. The development of FS should attract customers looking to diversify supply chains in the U.S. and Europe in response to supply shortages and geopolitical considerations, as well as strong secular demand for semiconductors, but <b>Intel</b> may be challenged to attract customers with whom it also competes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >To meet <b>Intel</b>'s aspirations to build a FS business rivaling those of current foundry leaders, Fitch believes investment intensity will need to increase and could weigh on the company's strong FCF profile. Profitability growth will offset higher spending levels over the longer-term but Fitch anticipates equipment purchases and start-up costs will pressure nearer-term cash flow, absent government support. During the update, <b>Intel</b> raised 2021 capital spending guidance by $5 billion to $20 billion to begin construction on two U.S. fabrication facilities that will, in part, support FS development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As a result of the uptick in capital spending, <b>Intel</b> guided to $10 billion of pre-dividend FCF for 2021, which is below Fitch's previous forecast. Therefore, Fitch estimates pre-dividend FCF to debt near 30% and FCF (post-dividend) margins in the mid- to high-single digits, both of which, if sustained, Fitch believes are more aligned with a mid-'A' rating. Meanwhile, Fitch expects <b>Intel</b> will limit stock buybacks to lower than historical FCF.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-30 October 2020: Fitch has placed <span class="companylink">Xilinx Inc</span>.'s the 'A-' ratings, including the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), on Watch Negative on the announcement that the company entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. (AMD) in an all-stock transaction valued at $35 billion. Fitch's actions affect $2.4 billion, including the undrawn $400 million revolving credit facility (RCF). Fitch plans to resolve the RWN upon a review of the final debt and guarantee structure and resolution could result in affirmation at 'A-' or a multi-notch downgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The explanation for the proposed deal asserts that in an intensifying datacenter (DC)-competitive landscape, the combined companies will have an increased revenue scale to support research and development, technology and product diversification and addressable market expansion. Nonetheless, Fitch believes <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> bondholders face increased risk related to the sustainability of rapid expected share gains by AMD, given its ascendance in core markets for competitors with still considerably greater market share and financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >AMD's process technology advantage over <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. may very well evaporate in 2022 should <b>Intel</b> outsource leading edge manufacturing to the same foundry producing chips for AMD, enabling <b>Intel</b> to recapture share in certain markets via scale. Graphics capabilities should advantage AMD over <b>Intel</b> in certain artificial intelligence (AI) markets, but <span class="companylink">NVIDIA Inc</span>.'s still meaningful technology and share leadership positions it to capture the lion's share of rapidly increasing AI penetration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Meanwhile, Fitch expects solid near-term operating performance for standalone <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> driven by strong market positions and end market diversification. Despite uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus pandemic and global trade tensions, automotive production levels are recovering, and <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> is benefiting from healthy design win rates and accelerating product ramps in DC and wireless markets. Profit and cash flow margins remain healthy and, in conjunction with more cautious shareholder returns year-to-date, are supporting <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s strong financial profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Impact: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> to weather the coronavirus pandemic relatively well given the company's end market, customer and product diversification resulting in broad based design wins and product ramps. Exposure to more cyclical markets (automotive, broadcast) weighed heavily on revenue in the first half of the year, but recovering automotive production levels and product ramps should drive near-term growth. Product ramps should also augment already strong infrastructure markets, particularly advanced networking products for DC, given work-from-home (WFH) dynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology leadership: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> will leverage its long-existing technology leadership in programmable logic as the company continues its strategic focus on platforms that will enable it to expand addressable markets. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s leadership in 28nm and 16nm systems-on-a-chip (SoC) are driving strong adoption across the company's end markets, particularly for the first wave of 5G deployments in wireless and DC. At the same time, its next generation 7nm-based adaptive compute acceleration platforms (ACAP) are well positioned to drive future growth, given they address robust demand for compute, storage and networking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Moderating Profit Margins: Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s profit margins will remain solid constrained by strong growth in less profitable wireless communications and core broadcast, consumer and automotive markets. However, <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> has maintained record high non-GAAP gross profit margins of 70% in fiscal 1H21, despite facing headwinds from the coronavirus and a challenging global trade environment. Over the intermediate term, <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> will partially offset margin pressure with revenue growth, while robust adoption of ACAP should drive longer-term profit margin expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Significant Technology Risk: Despite clear technology leadership in programmable logic, Fitch expects heightened competitive intensity as <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> continues pushing further into the semiconductor industry's most attractive growth markets, including the dynamically evolving DC markets, automotive, industrial and 5G. Fitch expects <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> competitors, <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> and <b>Intel</b>, will leverage their greater financial flexibility to maintain aggressive investment levels, while significant custom application-specific-integrated-circuits (ASICs) development will sustain displacement risk. As a result, Xilinx's R&D will remain more than 20% of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Meaningful Revenue Diversification: Fitch expects significant application, and end market and geographic diversification will continue to moderate cyclicality. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s design wins for 5G deployments and long-cycle A&D, as well as DC spending by hyperscale should offset weak demand in more macroeconomic-sensitive end markets in fiscal 2021. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s low inventory obsolescence risk due to the company's product adaptability also reduces cyclicality. Nonetheless, Fitch anticipates <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s focus on DC growth should modestly increase customer concentration but from currently relatively low levels with the top 20 customers constituting 40% of revenue and top 50 customers representing 60% of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> is well positioned at 'A-' given the company's strong IP in a diversified set of secular growth markets and solid profit margins and FCF conversion. <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> is less well positioned than its closest peers, <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. (A+/F1/Stable) and <span class="companylink">NVIDIA Inc</span>. (A/F1/Stable), due to their superior financial flexibility despite an uptick in leverage for both companies as they navigate through the coronavirus pandemic. <b>Intel</b>'s very strong market positions in CPUs for personal computers (PC) and DC servers drives significant annual FCF, despite the company's also significant annual capital spending budget that results in higher absolute FCF but lower FCF margins when compared with <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>. Fitch also expects <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> to manage leverage to below 1.5x, and the company benefits from dominant positions in graphics processing units (GPU) that result in high profit margins and substantial FCF. Should <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> take share from <b>Intel</b> and <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span>, it will be due to the success of its platform strategy and superior technological attributes in computer acceleration, which will drive convergence in the ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue growth down by roughly low- to mid-single digits in fiscal 2021 driven by demand headwinds related to the coronavirus pandemic, partially offset by WFH dynamics, relative strength in DC and 5G deployments;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Low-single digit recovery fiscal 2022 and the resumption of normalized mid-single digit growth in fiscal 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Moderate profit margin contraction from a growing mix of lower-gross profit margin revenue offset by only modest operating expense growth, resulting in operating EBITDA margins in the mid- to high-30% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Refinances upcoming debt maturities but manages debt levels to maintain total debt to operating EBITDA below 2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Uses FCF for tuck-in acquisitions and capital returns, although Fitch anticipates stock buybacks will remain muted in fiscal 2021 due to the current lack of visibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Commitment to maintain total debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x and total debt to FCF below 2.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Evidence supporting <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s platform leadership, including share gains in DC, slowing displacement by ASICs or operating EBITDA margins sustained in the 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Expectations for total debt to operating EBITDA sustained above 2x or total debt to FCF above 3x from structurally weaker than anticipated operating performance, or serial acquisitions or intensified shareholder returns;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Evidence that <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span>'s platforms are insufficiently compelling to stem the pace of ASICs displacement or market share losses, or operating EBITDA margins sustained in the 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Fitch expects liquidity for <span class="companylink">Xilinx</span> will remain solid and supported by: i) $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, ii) $1.9 billion of short-term investments and iii) an undrawn $400 million RCF expiring in Dec. 2021. Fitch's expectation for more than $500 million of annual FCF also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity(ies), either due to their nature or to the way in which they are being managed by the entity(ies). For more information on Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores, visit www.fitchratings.com/esg[http://www.fitchratings.com/esg].</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-27 October 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. at 'A+'/'F1' and the 'A+' IDR for its wholly-owned subsidiary, <span class="companylink">Altera Corp</span>., following the company's Oct. 22, 2020 third quarter earnings release. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's actions affect $35.2 billion of total debt as of Sept. 26, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <b>Intel</b>'s solid financial profile and flexibility, despite expectations for personal computer (PC) and datacenter (DC) market share erosion as the company addresses delays in its advanced manufacturing roadmap. Nonetheless, Fitch believes the company's looming decision on to what extent it outsources leading edge manufacturing could weigh on <b>Intel</b>'s credit profile. Structurally lower profit margins and reduced product differentiation the likely result, in any case, but with the attendant capital commitments should the company remain committed to advanced manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Over the nearer term, a lower sales mix and 10nm product ramp will constrain gross profit margins after stronger than expected 1H20 operating performance that should still drive record revenue and FCF margins. Strong 10 nanometer (nm) adoption in entry level notebooks and design win strength in Mobileye are unlikely to offset guidance for the continuation of very weak enterprise and government (E&G) demand and cloud digestion. Fitch expects <b>Intel</b> will begin recovery in 2021 with an richer sales mix driving adjusted gross profit margin expansion through the year from mid- to high-50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong annual FCF will augment elevated cash levels from debt issuance earlier in 2020 amid uncertainty surround the coronavirus to replenish cash as the company completes the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement in the current (4Q20). Fitch anticipates <b>Intel</b> will use net proceeds from <b>Intel</b>'s proposed sale of its NAND business to <span class="companylink">SK Hynix</span> for $9 billion to support future shareholder returns rather than building cash in the face of competitive uncertainly, although leverage metrics should remain sound for the rating, including total debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Impact: Fitch expects sequentially lower revenue in the second half of the year after government imposed stay-in-place orders and supply chain disruptions drove strong demand for WFH-enabling infrastructure. As a result, revenue was sequentially flat in the typically seasonally down (mid-teens) first half of 2020 and Fitch forecasts operating EBITDA margins on-track to reach a record 50.3% for the full year. Nonetheless, Fitch remains concerned first half strength represented the pull forward of a considerable amount of demand and that, in conjunction with market share losses and the waning PC refresh cycle, revenue growth will decline over the near-term before beginning to recover in the second half of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Eroding Technology Leadership: <b>Intel</b>'s more recent process technology transition challenges have eroded the company's long-standing technology leadership, potentially threatening the company's dominant market share and premium profit margins over the medium term. Process technology is the most important but only one of six dimensions for product differentiation in these markets but <b>Intel</b>'s inability to keep pace with technology leaders, <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co</span>. (TSMC), illustrates heightened risks associated with the breakdown of Moore's Law. It also will result in market share gains by competitors, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. (AMD) and <span class="companylink">NVIDIA Inc</span>., and prompted <b>Intel</b> to increase outsourcing of leading edge products to TSMC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Very Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s strong market positions in DCs and PCs will continue to support the company's ability to intensify investments while driving strong financial flexibility for acquisitions. Positive top-line growth in data-centric businesses, which include the company's IoT, non-volatile memory, programmable solutions and automotive, will more than offset secular shipment declines in PC markets. <b>Intel</b> should continue to benefit from solid growth and market share in PCs, gaming and DC server chips, despite expected near-term share gains by competitors and Fitch's expectation that cloud service providers (CSPs) will support alternative architectures to ensure long-term innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will range from $10 billion to $15 billion over the forecast period, driven by strong operating EBITDA margins (mid- to high-40%) offsetting significant capital intensity (near 20% of revenue). Weaker near-term demand from the coronavirus pandemic will only marginally dampen FCF resulting in a Fitch forecast $12 billion of 2020 FCF after generating $7.8 billion in just the first half of the year. Fitch expects solid FCF beyond the near term due in part to the company's management of the PC business for profitability and cash flow and a shifting sales mix toward higher-margin DC platforms despite faster growing lower margin other data-centric segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Investment Intensity: R&D and capital spending will remain significant and represent 35%-40% of revenue for the foreseeable future even if <b>Intel</b> increases outsourcing of leading edge manufacturing. The company's recent 7nm process technology delay is indicative of the break-down of Moore's Law, although manufacturing competitors, TSMC and <span class="companylink">Samsung Electronics Ltd</span>., are already producing at volume on 7nm, which should prompt <b>Intel</b> to maintain high investment levels to catch-up. <b>Intel</b> is also investing heavily to drive adoption of its non-volatile memory and develops technology platforms within the context of rapidly evolving emerging IoT, PSG and automotive markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify over time as service providers consolidate IT spending, potentially resulting in more volatile quarterly results in DCG. Fitch anticipates the largest hyperscale cloud companies will continue robust data center capacity deployments over the intermediate term and through cyclical downturns, driven by increasing demand for computing and storage of data growth and ongoing workload migration to public clouds. Telecom service providers will also continue deploying capacity as data proliferates exponentially at the edge, although longer-term growth in IoT and ADAS should mitigate some customer concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. (A+/F1/Stable) is less well positioned at the current rating, given its solid financial profile may be insufficient to offset a weakened business profile. Process technology delays over the past several years are requiring <b>Intel</b> to differentiate products on other dimensions at non-leading edge process nodes and evaluate if and to what degree it will outsource 7nm and below manufacturing to technology leader, <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd</span>. (TSMC), going forward. This is as competitors, both already fabless customers of TSMC and are shipping 7nm products in volume, are poised to take share from <b>Intel</b> - <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. (AMD) in processors for servers and personal computers (PC) and <span class="companylink">NVIDIA Inc</span>. in artificial intelligence (AI) markets, which will intensify further if <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> consummates its proposed acquisition of <span class="companylink">ARM Holdings Ltd</span>. Outsourcing its advanced node chip manufacturing would further weigh on <b>Intel</b>'s rich gross profit margins (high 50% on an non-GAAP basis), but with FCF benefitting from a significant reduction in the company's roughly $15 billion of annual capital spending, the majority focused on leading edge process technology. <b>Intel</b>'s $10 billion accelerated share repurchases (ASR) agreement announced on Aug. 21, 2020 likely means the company's debt will remain at roughly current levels with leverage metrics limiting just under Fitch's negative rating sensitivities. Over the longer term, the expectations for automotive and, to a lesser extent, internet of things (IoT), should begin diversifying <b>Intel</b>'s revenue mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Resumption of flat to low-single digit revenue growth in 2022-2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margin remains in mid-50% through FY21H1 before expanding to mid- to high-50% in 2021 as company ramps 10nm production, cloud completes digestion, E&G spending resumes, as well as the memory business sale closes;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Spending remains relatively flat in FY20Q4 and 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex is roughly 20% of revenue, except modest uptick in 2021 due to lower revenue level as <b>Intel</b> invests in closing technology leadership gap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends grow by low-single digits annually;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Beyond completion of the ASR, <b>Intel</b> uses annual FCF for stock buybacks;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> uses net proceeds from the $7 billion cash payment upon closing the sale of its memory business to <span class="companylink">SK Hynix</span> to support liquidity, effectively funding a significant portion of the company's $10 billion ASR;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities to maintain total debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- <b>Intel</b> maintains its greater than 80% share in data-center markets while maintaining industry in-line profit margins, demonstrating technology leadership in the face of intensifying competition from alternative architectures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Solid adoption of <b>Intel</b>'s IoT, PSG and Mobileye platforms, resulting in these businesses representing half of all non-Computing Solutions Group (CSG) revenue in aggregate, underscoring the company technology roadmap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Non-GAAP gross profit margins sustained in the low- to mid-50%, driven by meaningful DC market share erosion or significantly higher outsourcing rates;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG or weaker than anticipated contribution from <b>Intel</b>'s IoT, PSG and Mobileye platforms;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total debt to operating EBITDA and to FCF sustained above 1.5x the mid-single digits from intensified shareholder returns or meaningfully weaker than expected operating performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity will be strong exiting 2020 and remain solid through the forecast period. As of Sept. 26, 2020, liquidity was supported by $18.3 billion, $8.3 billion pro forma for the $10 billion ASR but before net proceeds from <span class="companylink">SK Hynix</span> for the proposed sale of <b>Intel</b>'s memory business. <b>Intel</b> historically has relied upon CP borrowings under its authorization up to $10 billion to support liquidity. Fitch's expectation for annual FCF of more than $10 billion also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch made no material financial statement adjustments to the published financial statements for <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-21 August 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corp</span>. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, <span class="companylink">Altera Corp</span>., including the 'A+'/'F1' long- and short-term Issuer Default Ratings on the company's announcement that it entered into a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. The rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's actions affect $37 billion of total debt as of June 27, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <b>Intel</b>'s strong financial flexibility and market positions, which should provide sufficient cash flow and time to recover from operational missteps that have resulted in the company falling further behind in manufacturing process technology and expectations for share losses. <b>Intel</b> reported robust revenue and profitability growth in the 1H20, translating into more than $7 billion of FCF, and positions the company to outperform Fitch's original expectations for the year despite guidance for negative second half sequential revenue growth and lower profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >After robust first half shipments to support a work-from-home (WFH) infrastructure on the edge and in the cloud, <b>Intel</b> pointed to customer digestion and a mature Win 10 personal computer (PC) refresh cycle as second half headwinds. Fitch expects share losses will exacerbate weaker demand and dampen <b>Intel</b>'s recovery in 2021 despite the anticipated resumption of secular growth trends. Fitch now expects flat- to low-single digit compounded annual revenue growth rate through the remainder of the forecast period versus prior expectations for mid-single digit positive growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >After challenges achieving efficient yields at 10nm, <b>Intel</b> recently announced the delay of its 7nm process technology by at least an additional six months 2022-2023, even as competitors are already shipping 7nm-based processors in volume. As a result, <b>Intel</b> will be challenged to maintain more than 80% market share in its most profitable business, datacenters (DC), over the medium-term, despite other product differentiation dimensions. Meanwhile, Fitch believes <b>Intel</b>'s plan to increase outsourced manufacturing of advanced products could signal a willingness to cede process technology leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In response to the adverse impact on its share price, <b>Intel</b> announced a $10 billion ASR agreement after suspending share repurchases on March 24, 2020 given uncertainty surrounding the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The ASR will substantially complete the remaining $12.4 billion under the $20 billion share repurchase authorization from the fall of 2019. The ASR and $4.2 billion spent on stock buybacks in 1Q20 will approximate FCF for 2020 and, absent incremental stock buybacks, still result in nearly $20 billion of available cash ending the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Impact: Fitch expects sequentially lower revenue in 2H20 after government imposed stay-in-place orders and supply chain disruptions drove strong demand for WFH-enabling infrastructure. As a result, revenue was sequentially flat in the typically seasonally down (mid-teens) 1H20 and Fitch forecasts operating EBITDA margins on-track to reach a record 50.3% for the full year. Nonetheless, Fitch remains concerned first half strength represented the pull forward of a considerable amount of demand and that, in conjunction with market share losses and the waning PC refresh cycle, revenue growth will decline over the near-term before beginning to recover in the 2H21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Eroding Technology Leadership: <b>Intel</b>'s more recent process technology transition challenges have eroded the company's long-standing technology leadership, potentially threatening the company's dominant market share and premium profit margins over the medium-term. Process technology is the most important but only one of six dimensions for product differentiation in these markets but <b>Intel</b>'s inability to keep pace with technology leaders, <span class="companylink">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co</span>. (TSMC), illustrates heightened risks associated with the breakdown of Moore's Law. It also will result in market share gains by competitors, <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices Inc</span>. (AMD) and <span class="companylink">NVIDIA Inc</span>., and prompted <b>Intel</b> to increase outsourcing of leading edge products to TSMC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Very Strong Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s strong market positions in DCs and PCs will continue to support the company's ability to intensify investments while driving strong financial flexibility for acquisitions. Positive top-line growth in data-centric businesses, which include the company's Internet of Things (IoT), non-volatile memory, programmable solutions and automotive, will more than offset secular shipment declines in PC markets. <b>Intel</b> should continue to benefit from solid growth and market share in PCs, gaming and DC server chips, despite expected near-term share gains by competitors and Fitch's expectation that cloud service providers (CSPs) will support alternative architectures to ensure long-term innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will range from $10 billion to $15 billion over the forecast period, driven by strong operating EBITDA margins (mid- to high-40%) offsetting significant capital intensity (near 20% of revenue) and double-digit annual dividend growth. Weaker near-term demand from the coronavirus pandemic will only marginally dampen FCF resulting in a Fitch forecasted $12 billion of 2020 FCF after generating $7.8 billion in just 1H20. Fitch expects solid FCF beyond the near term due in part to the company's management of the PC business for profitability and cash flow and a shifting sales mix toward higher-margin DC platforms despite faster growing lower margin other data-centric segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Investment Intensity: R&D and capital spending will remain significant and represent 35%-40% of revenue for the foreseeable future even if <b>Intel</b> increases outsourcing of leading edge manufacturing. The company's recent 7nm process technology delay is indicative of the break-down of Moore's Law, although manufacturing competitors, TSMC and <span class="companylink">Samsung Electronics Ltd</span>., are already producing at volume on 7nm, which should prompt <b>Intel</b> to maintain high investment levels to catch-up. <b>Intel</b> is also investing heavily to drive adoption of its non-volatile memory and develops technology platforms within the context of rapidly evolving emerging IoT, PSG and automotive markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify over time as service providers consolidate IT spending, potentially resulting in more volatile quarterly results in DCG. Fitch anticipates the largest hyperscale cloud companies will continue robust data center capacity deployments over the intermediate term and through cyclical downturns, driven by increasing demand for computing and storage of data growth and ongoing workload migration to public clouds. Telecom service providers will also continue deploying capacity as data proliferates exponentially at the edge, although longer-term growth in IoT and ADAS should mitigate some customer concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects solid operating performance for the rating, even in the face of near-term competition in platforms for DC and competing architectures for AI markets over the longer term. <b>Intel</b> compares favorably with its chief competitor for data center server chips, AMD, because of <b>Intel</b>'s significantly greater financial flexibility, profit margins and market share. <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> (A/F1/Stable), with whom <b>Intel</b> is competing for AI and deep learning, has a similar profile to <b>Intel</b>, although nominal FCF is meaningfully lower but with significantly higher FCF margins due to its fabless model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Revenue declines in 2H20 followed by high single digits and mid-single digits in 2021 with recovery beginning in the second half;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Resumption of flat to low-single digit revenue growth in 2022-2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margin contraction in CY20H2 and 2021 before resumption of positive revenue growth drives margins back to the high 50%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Spending remains relatively flat in CY20H2 and 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex is roughly 20% of revenue, except modest uptick in 2021 due to lower revenue level as <b>Intel</b> invests in closing technology leadership gap;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends grow by 15% in 2020 and 10% annually thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Company uses FCF for stock buybacks, including completion of the ASR in 2020 and returning roughly half of net proceeds from the March 2020 $8 billion debt issuance to shareholders in 2021 and the other in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> refinances upcoming debt maturities to maintain total debt to operating EBITDA near 1x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Management's commitment to moderate shareholder returns to maintain total leverage below 1x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<b>Intel</b> maintains strong (greater than 80% share) in data center markets, despite intensifying competition from alternate architectures, driven by a resumption of technology leadership;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Solid adoption of <b>Intel</b>'s NSG and the company's IoT, PSG and Mobileye platforms, resulting in these businesses representing half of all non-CCG revenue in aggregate and underscoring the company technology roadmap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Non-GAAP gross profit margins sustained in the low- to mid-50%, driven by meaningful DC market share erosion and greater than anticipated outsourcing;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG or weaker than anticipated adoption of <b>Intel</b>'s nonvolatile memory and IoT, PSG and Mobileye platforms;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total debt to operating EBITDA and to FCF sustained above 1.5x the mid-single digits from intensified shareholder returns amid weaker than expected operating performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity will be strong exiting 2020 and remain solid through the forecast period, despite the ASR. As of June 27, 2020, liquidity was supported by $25.8 billion ($15.8 billion pro forma for the ASR). <b>Intel</b> historically has relied upon CP borrowings under its authorization up to $10 billion to support liquidity. Fitch's expectation for annual FCF of more than $10 billion also supports liquidity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-01 May 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span> and its wholly owned subsidiary, <span class="companylink">Altera Corporation</span>, including the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'A+' and 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's actions affect $39 billion of total debt as of March 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and outlook reflect <b>Intel</b>'s strong market positions, which positions the company to generate significant FCF while continuing to spend substantially on manufacturing technology innovation through the coronavirus pandemic. Fitch believes recent robust results reflect a temporary acceleration rather than a permanent shift in demand and that datacenter (DC) demand will moderate but continue growing, offsetting expectations for lower PC unit shipments and share losses through the remainder of the year. Beyond the coronavirus pandemic, Fitch expects share losses in DC to offset growth in automotive and internet of things (IoT) markets, potentially weighing on intermediate-term revenue levels and profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher revenue and lower but still solid profitability should translate into strong FCF that, in conjunction with the company's $10.3 billion senior notes offering in the first quarter and suspended share repurchase program, should result in considerable excess cash exiting 2020. Fitch expects <b>Intel</b> will maintain a conservative financial structure and estimates total leverage was at 1.0x, despite the senior notes issuance and lower forecasted profitability. Given headroom under Fitch's 1.5x total debt to operating EBITDA negative rating trigger and $13.4 billion remaining under <b>Intel</b>'s $20 billion share repurchase authorization, Fitch believes <b>Intel</b>'s higher debt total is likely permanent rather than pre-funding considerable debt maturities over the next three years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Impact: Fitch assumes government imposed stay-in-place orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic will result in a significant first-half downturn and partial recovery beginning in the second half of 2020, followed by slow growth to achieve full recovery on a run rate basis exiting 2021. Within this context, Fitch believes end market mix and financial flexibility will determine the coronavirus' impact on semiconductor credit profiles. Issuers with greater exposure to infrastructure markets (5G and DC), such as <b>Intel</b>'s DC sales to service providers, will outperform those exposed to more GDP-sensitive markets (e.g. automotive, consumer and industrial).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This includes <b>Intel</b>'s PC business beyond the recent quarter's surge in demand supporting work/learn-at-home and gaming. Meanwhile, issuers with headroom under Fitch's negative leverage sensitivities, like <b>Intel</b>, are less likely to face negative rating actions despite the base case for lower profitability through 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s strong market positions in its data center and PC businesses provide significant revenue scale to support high investment intensity (35%-40% of revenue). Positive top-line growth in data-centric businesses, which include the company's IoT, non-volatile memory, programmable solutions and automotive, will more than offset secular shipment declines in PC markets. <b>Intel</b> should continue to benefit from solid growth and market share in data center server chips, despite expected near-term share gains by AMD and Fitch's expectation that cloud service providers (CSPs) will support alternative architectures to ensure long-term innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology Leadership: <b>Intel</b>'s significant cumulative investments in R&D and manufacturing capabilities have resulted in technology leadership and support Fitch's expectations for top line growth and solid profitability through at least the intermediate term. Significant investments in capital spending throughout its history leaves the company as one of three remaining leading edge semiconductor manufacturers , sustaining the company's cost advantage in data center growth and legacy PC markets. Nonetheless, delays in <b>Intel</b>'s 10nm shipments underscore the technology risk inherent to <b>Intel</b>'s growth markets and are expected to result in share losses to AMD and more aggressive pricing, although expanding capabilities at 14nm will drive solid share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will approach $10 billion, driven by strong operating EBITDA margins (mid-40s) offsetting significant capital intensity (near 20% of revenue) and mid-single-digit annual dividend growth. Deteriorating near-term demand from the coronavirus pandemic will dampen FCF for 2020. Fitch expects solid FCF beyond the near term due in part to the company's management of its PC business for profitability and cash flow in the face of shipment declines and a shifting sales mix toward higher-margin data center platforms. <b>Intel</b>'s faster growing other data-centric segments will diversify sales mix but dilute profit margins over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Investment Intensity: R&D and capital spending will continue to represent 35%-40% of revenue for the foreseeable future as <b>Intel</b> builds capacity to drive adoption of its non-volatile memory and develops technology platforms within the context of rapidly evolving emerging IoT, PSG and automotive markets. The company's high investment intensity also supports production technology transitions that will enable the Data Center Group (DCG) segment in maintaining strong market share and gross profit margins with CSPs as well as continuing to optimize the legacy PC business for profitability and cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify over time as CSPs consolidate IT spending, potentially resulting in more volatile quarterly results in DCG. Fitch anticipates the largest hyperscale cloud companies will continue robust data center capacity deployments over the intermediate term and through cyclical downturns, driven by increasing demand for computing and storage of explosive data growth and ongoing workload migration to public clouds. Nonetheless, longer-term growth in IoT and ADAS should mitigate some customer concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects solid operating performance for the rating, even in the face of near-term competition in platforms for DC and competing architectures for artificial intelligence (AI) markets over the longer term. <b>Intel</b> compares favorably with its chief competitor for data center server chips, AMD, given <b>Intel</b>'s significantly greater financial flexibility, profit margins and market share. <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> ('A/F1'/Stable), with whom <b>Intel</b> is competing for AI and deep learning, has a similar profile to <b>Intel</b>, although nominal FCF is meaningfully lower but with significantly higher FCF margins due to its fabless model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-For 2020, low-single digit revenue growth driven by service provider server sales offset by lower PC demand, despite a surge in demand in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Revenue down slightly in 2021 due to competitive pressures in DC markets, including share gains by competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Low-single digit recovery in 2022 and growth in 2023 as <b>Intel</b> returns its manufacturing footprint to competitiveness and increasingly benefits from non-CPU businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-EBITDA margins declining from the high 40% in 2020 to mid-40% beyond the near-term, driven by competitive pressures in DC and increasing contributions from lower-margin businesses weighing on gross profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Capital spending above 20% through the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-10% annual dividend growth with FCF used for tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-<b>Intel</b> refinances all upcoming debt maturities and uses excess cash for buybacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Management's commitment to moderate shareholder returns to maintain total leverage below 1x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- <b>Intel</b> maintains strong (greater than 80% share) in data center markets, despite intensifying competition from alternate architectures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Solid adoption of <b>Intel</b>'s NSG and the company's IoT, PSG and Mobileye platforms, resulting in these businesses representing half of all non-CCG revenue in aggregate and underscoring the company technology roadmap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- FCF margins sustained in the mid-single-digits, driven by meaningful data center market share erosion and profit margin contraction while investment levels remain consistent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG or weaker than anticipated adoption of <b>Intel</b>'s non-volatile memory and IoT, PSG and Mobileye platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total leverage sustained above 1.5x, likely from intensified shareholder returns amid weaker than expected operating performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid liquidity: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s liquidity will be strong exiting 2020 and remain solid through the forecast period, given the likelihood the company will use excess cash for share repurchases or debt reduction. As of March 31, 2020, liquidity was supported by $20.8 billion, given the company's $10.3 billion of senior notes issuance during the quarter to support liquidity amid unfavorable commercial paper (CP) market conditions. <b>Intel</b> historically has relied upon CP borrowings under its authorization up to $10 billion to support liquidity. Fitch's expectation for annual FCF approaching $10 billion also supports liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3. ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-23 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned an 'A+' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span>'s $8 billion of senior notes issuance, which will be pari passu with <b>Intel</b>'s existing senior unsecured debt obligations. The company will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing existing debt and share repurchases, although Fitch expects share repurchases will not exceed FCF for the year. The issuance consists of six tranches and includes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$1.5 billion of 3.4% senior notes due March 25, 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$1 billion of 3.75% senior notes due March 25, 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$1.5 billion of 3.9% senior notes due March 25, 2030;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$750 million of 4.6% senior notes due March 25, 2040;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$2.25 billion of 4.75% senior notes due March 25, 2050;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$1 billion of 4.95% senior notes due March 25, 2060.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pro forma for the $8 billion senior notes issuance, as well as the $2.25 billion senior notes issuance in February 2020 and undrawn CP authorization, total debt was $49.3 billion as of Dec. 28, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The current ratings and outlook reflect <b>Intel</b>'s substantial financial flexibility, bolstered by the senior notes issuance (and in light of unfavorable CP market conditions) that will enable the company to absorb lower near-term cash flow related to the coronavirus pandemic. Beyond the near term, the company should continue to benefit from strong share positions in secular growth datacenter markets and personal computers (PC), despite Fitch's expectations for share losses over time. Meanwhile, the development of 5G-enabled semi-autonomous driving and internet of things (IoT) markets provide longer-term growth potential. Fitch expects FCF will be considerably lower than the record $11.4 billion generated in 2019 and that <b>Intel</b> will curtail share repurchases to remain in line with FCF and maintain total debt to operating EBITDA below Fitch's 1.5x negative rating trigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s strong market positions in its data center and PC businesses provide significant revenue scale to support high investment intensity (35%-40% of revenue). Positive top-line growth in data-centric businesses, which include the company's IoT, non-volatile memory, programmable solutions and automotive, will more than offset secular shipment declines in PC markets. <b>Intel</b> should continue to benefit from solid growth and market share in data center server chips, despite expected near-term share gains by AMD and Fitch's expectation that cloud service providers (CSPs) will support alternative architectures to ensure long-term innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology Leadership: <b>Intel</b>'s significant cumulative investments in R&D and manufacturing capabilities have resulted in technology leadership and support Fitch's expectations for top line growth and solid profitability through at least the intermediate term. Significant investments in capital spending throughout its history leaves the company as one of three remaining semiconductor manufacturers at the leading edge, which has sustained the company's cost advantage in data center growth and legacy PC markets. Nonetheless, delays in <b>Intel</b>'s 10nm shipments underscoring technology risk inherent to <b>Intel</b>'s growth markets and are expected to result in share losses to AMD and more aggressive pricing, although expanding capabilities at 14nm will drive solid share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will range from $6 billion-$8 billion, driven by strong operating EBITDA margins (mid-40s) offsetting significant capital intensity (near 20% of revenue) and mid-single-digit annual dividend growth. Deteriorating near-term demand from the coronavirus pandemic and uncertain global trade environment will dampen FCF for 2020. Fitch expects FCF beyond the near term will be solid due in part to the company's management of its PC business for profitability and cash flow in the face of shipment declines and a shifting sales mix toward higher-margin data center platforms. <b>Intel</b>'s faster growing other data centric segments will diversify its sales mix but dilute profit margins over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Investment Intensity: R&D and capital spending will continue to represent 35%-40% of revenue for the foreseeable future as <b>Intel</b> builds capacity to drive adoption of its non-volatile memory and develops technology platforms within the context of rapidly evolving emerging IoT, PSG and automotive markets. The company's high investment intensity also supports production technology transitions that will enable the Data Center Group (DCG) segment to maintain strong market share and gross profit margins with CSPs, as well as continue to optimize the legacy PC business for profitability and cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify over time as CSP consolidate information technology (IT) spending, potentially resulting in more volatile quarterly results in DCG. Fitch anticipates the largest hyperscale cloud companies will continue robust data center capacity deployments over the intermediate term and through cyclical downturns, driven by increasing demand for computing and storage of explosive data growth and ongoing workload migration to public clouds. Nonetheless, longer-term growth in IoT and ADAS should mitigate some customer concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch expects potentially significant headwinds related to the coronavirus pandemic, operating performance should be solid beyond the near term even in the face of competition in platforms for DC and competing architectures for artificial intelligence (AI) markets over the longer term. <b>Intel</b> compares favorably with its chief competitor for data center server chips, AMD, given <b>Intel</b>'s significantly greater financial flexibility, profit margins and market share. <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> (A-/F2/Positive), with whom <b>Intel</b> is competing for AI and deep learning, has a similar profile to <b>Intel</b>, although nominal FCF is meaningfully lower but with significantly higher FCF margins due to its fabless model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--For 2020, the coronavirus pandemic should exacerbate headwinds from cautious enterprise spending, the completion of a Win 10 drive PC refresh cycle and share losses to AMD, meaningfully more than offsetting positive momentum from the resumption of hyperscale spending. As a result, revenue growth could be down in the high-single to low-double digits for 2020.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-18 February 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned an 'A+' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Intel</b> Corporation</span>'s $2.25 billion of senior notes issuance, consisting of: i) $750 million of 2.45% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2029, ii) $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2049 and iii) $1 billion of 3.1% senior notes due Feb. 15, 2060. The senior notes are pari passu with <b>Intel</b>'s existing senior unsecured debt obligations and the company will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing existing debt and share repurchases. Pro forma for the $2.25 billion notes issuance and undrawn CP authorization, total debt was $41.3 billion as of Dec. 28, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The current ratings and outlook reflect Fitch's expectation for solid operating performance despite the anticipation of share gains by competitors in data center and personal computer (PC) markets, as well as near-term macroeconomic, assuming no meaningful supply constraints related to coronavirus. Fitch expects profit margin pressures from share shifting and <b>Intel</b>'s diversifying revenue base but that operating EBITDA margins will remain in the mid-40%, resulting in significant cash flow through the forecast period. For 2019, FCF was a record $11.4 billion in 2019, despite elevated capital spending to alleviate CPU supply constraints. Fitch expects <b>Intel</b> will use FCF for tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases, while maintaining total debt to operating EBITDA near 1x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leading Market Positions: <b>Intel</b>'s strong market positions in its data center and PC businesses provide significant revenue scale to support high investment intensity (35%-40% of revenue). Positive top-line growth in data-centric businesses, which include the company's internet of things (IoT), non-volatile memory, programmable solutions and automotive, will more than offset secular shipment declines in PC markets. <b>Intel</b> should continue to benefit from solid growth and market share in data center server chips, despite expected near-term share gains by AMD and Fitch's expectation that cloud service providers (CSPs) will support alternative architectures to ensure long-term innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Technology Leadership: <b>Intel</b>'s significant cumulative investments in R&D and manufacturing capabilities have resulted in technology leadership and support Fitch's expectations for top line growth and solid profitability through at least the intermediate term. Significant investments in capital spending throughout its history leaves the company as one of three remaining semiconductor manufacturers at the leading edge, which has sustained the company's cost advantage in data center growth and legacy PC markets. Nonetheless, delays in <b>Intel</b>'s 10nm shipments underscoring technology risk inherent to <b>Intel</b>'s growth markets and are expected to result in share losses to AMD and more aggressive pricing, although expanding capabilities at 14nm will drive solid share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects <b>Intel</b>'s annual FCF will range from $6 billion-$8 billion, driven by strong operating EBITDA margins (mid-40s) offsetting significant capital intensity (near 20% of revenue) and mid-single-digit annual dividend growth. Despite a weaker macroeconomic and uncertain global trade environment likely to persist through 2020, Fitch expects <b>Intel</b> will maintain stable operating EBITDA margins due in part to the company's management of its PC business for profitability and cash flow in the face of shipment declines and a shifting sales mix toward higher-margin data center platforms. <b>Intel</b>'s faster growing other data centric segments will diversify its sales mix but dilute profit margins over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Investment Intensity: R&D and capital spending will continue to represent 35%-40% of revenue for the foreseeable future as <b>Intel</b> builds capacity to drive adoption of its non-volatile memory and develops technology platforms within the context of rapidly evolving emerging IoT, PSG and automotive markets. The company's high investment intensity also supports production technology transitions that will enable the Data Center Group (DCG) segment to maintain strong market share and gross profit margins with CSPs, as well as continue to optimize the legacy PC business for profitability and cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify over time as CSP consolidate information technology (IT) spending, potentially resulting in more volatile quarterly results in DCG. Fitch anticipates the largest hyperscale cloud companies will continue robust data center capacity deployments over the intermediate term and through cyclical downturns, driven by increasing demand for computing and storage of explosive data growth and ongoing workload migration to public clouds. Nonetheless, longer-term growth in IoT and ADAS should mitigate some customer concentration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects solid operating performance for the rating, even in the face of near-term competition in platforms for data centerand competing architectures for artificial intelligence (AI) markets over the longer term. <b>Intel</b> compares favorably with its chief competitor for data center server chips, AMD, given <b>Intel</b>'s significantly greater financial flexibility, profit margins and market share. <span class="companylink">NVIDIA</span> (A-/F2/Positive), with whom <b>Intel</b> is competing for AI and deep learning, has a similar profile to <b>Intel</b>, although nominal FCF is meaningfully lower but with significantly higher FCF margins due to its fabless model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--For 2020, the resumption of hyperscale spending insufficient to offset headwinds from cautious enterprise spending, the completion of a Win 10-driven PC refresh cycle and share losses to AMD, resulting in low- to mid-single-digit negative revenue growth. The forecast assumes no meaningful supply constraints related to Coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue flat to down in 2021 due to competitive pressures in data center markets, including share gains by U competitor, AMD, and ARM-based server chip alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-single-digit recovery in 2022 as <b>Intel</b> returns its manufacturing footprint to competitiveness and benefits from accelerating growth in non-CPU businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross profit margins down by another 300 basis points in 2020 due to a combination of lower revenue and continued 10nm ramp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Competitive pressure in data center markets and increasing contribution from lower margin businesses constrain gross profit margins in mid-50% through the remainder of the forecast period with transitions to 7nm and investments in 5nm offsetting strengthening 10nm yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--MG&A spending remains near lower 8.5% levels following cost reductions in 2019 and lower variable compensation related to negative revenue growth, while R&D remains at 19% of revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending of more than 20% through the forecast period.</p>

FITCH MAY HAVE PROVIDED ANOTHER PERMISSIBLE SERVICE TO THE RATED ENTITY OR ITS RELATED THIRD PARTIES.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Copyright © 2020 by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings Ltd</span>. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>

<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>. is registered with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</span> as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the "NRSRO").
