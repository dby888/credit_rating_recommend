<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-07 March 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded <b>United Airlines</b>' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB' from 'BB-'. The Rating Outlooks is Positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The upgrade reflects a reduction in United's adjusted debt balance by $3 billion in 2024, or 8% of the prior year's adjusted debt balance. EBITDAR leverage ended 2024 at 3.7x, near <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior positive rating sensitivity. Net leverage declined to 2.1x as the company continues to hold elevated cash balances. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United's gross leverage to decline toward 3x over the next few years, consistent with 'BB' rating tolerances. The upgrade is further supported by higher-than-expected FCF, driven by lower capital spending and improving profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Positive Outlook reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for continued debt repayment and solid financial performance relative to peers. United's network investments and loyalty program offerings have solidified its market position in its fortress hubs, paving the way for increased profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EETCs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has upgraded or affirmed United's enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) ratings as follows:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$354.9 million class A certificates due in 2026 affirmed at 'A-'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>United Airlines</b> 2013-1:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$362.6 million class A certificates due in 2025 upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The upgrades are primarily driven by a one-notch upgrade of United's IDR to 'BB' from 'BB-'. The affirmations for tranches rated through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s top-down approach are driven by loan-to-value (LTV) ratios that continue to support the existing ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Reduction Improves Credit Metrics: United's credit metrics are improving due to debt repayment, positive results from strategic initiatives, lower fuel prices, and a healthy operating environment. EBITDAR leverage ended the year at 3.7x, down from 4.2x at YE 2023, aided by debt repayment totaling USD4.5 billion in 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case forecasts leverage will decline toward 3x over the next one to two years due to modestly declining debt balances. There is potential upside if United hits its margin expansion goals, compared with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for relatively flat margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's liquidity remains high, driving net metrics roughly in line with higher-rated <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span>, though <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Delta to produce better FCF over the next several years. United is targeting adjusted net leverage below 2x in 2025, down from 2.9x at YE 2023. EBITDAR fixed charge coverage has also improved to the high-3x range, above our previous positive rating sensitivity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects incremental EBITDAR coverage improvement to low-to-mid 4x range through the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Healthy Cash Flows and Liquidity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United to generate meaningful FCF in 2025, driven by a healthy operating environment and reduced capital spending from delays in aircraft deliveries. FCF is then likely to fall to neutral levels in 2026 as aircraft deliveries increase. Upcoming capital expenditures are well covered by United's projected cash flow generation and elevated liquidity position, which remains above its peers and pre-pandemic levels. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects share repurchases to be secondary in the use of liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Initiatives Strengthen Market Position: United's investments in its network and loyalty program offerings improve its market position in strategic hubs across the U.S. Leveraging its network and MileagePlus loyalty program, United provides customers with competitive travel offerings, including high-frequency routes across a wide range of destinations and comprehensive rewards and benefits. This combination of services attracts and retains a loyal customer base around its key hubs, allowing the company to benefit from premium pricing compared to its peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Profitability: Profit margins were flat in 2024 but have consistently performed well compared with peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects flat or slightly increasing margins in the next few years. This would leave margins below pre-pandemic levels but would result in sufficient cash flows to allow for continued credit metric improvement over time. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes there is potential upside to our forecast. Recent industry capacity restraint and benefits from United's ongoing United Next program may lead to more significant unit revenue gains in 2025 and 2026 compared to the modest growth incorporated into <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Constructive Operating Environment: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that demand for air travel will remain robust throughout 2025 evidenced by recent reports of solid booking trends through first quarter and the ongoing improvement in business and premium travel. Although we expect slower U.S. economic growth this year, consumers are likely to continue prioritizing travel spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Manageable Industry Capacity: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects airline pricing power to be supported by limits on seat supply driven by reduced capacity by domestic carriers and by original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production delays and engine maintenance issues. Examples include Southwest's commitment to limit capacity growth to 1%-2%, and <span class="companylink">Spirit</span>'s expectations for reduced capacity this year. However, cost inflation remains a headwind. Unit cost excluding fuel outpaced the growth of unit revenue in the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United Next Benefits: United is seeing benefits from its "United Next" fleet renewal plan, with the bulk of the planned improvement to come starting in 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that United's fleet transformation will have a positive impact on United's cost structure and on its competitive position in domestic markets. The aircraft on order will be significantly more fuel efficient both in terms of engine technology and in seats per departure. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the fleet renewal as particularly impactful for United's regional operations as it replaces smaller inefficient regional jets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EETCs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class AA Affirmations: The affirmation of United's class AA certificates for the 2019-2, 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions at 'A+' is supported by strong LTVs in the high-70% low-80% range, which gives them material headroom within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' stress scenario. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> affirmed the class AA certificates for the 2016-2 and the 2016-1 transactions at 'A'. They continue to pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' stress scenario with LTVs the mid-80% range. The 2016-2 LTVs increased slightly compared to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior review, due to a change in appraiser with moderately lower base values for the 777-300ER.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class A Affirmations and Upgrades: The affirmation of United's class A certificates for 2014-2 and 2014-1 at 'A' and 'A-', respectively, reflects steady LTVs since <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s last review in the high-80s to low-90% range. The values of the aircraft in this transaction have declined to the low-to-mid single digits, which is in line with our assumptions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 aircraft at 6% and 7%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The loan-to-value ratios for United's remaining transactions do not pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'BBB' Stress test, and according to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, are rated via a bottom-up approach and notched off of United's IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom-up approach calls for ratings to be notched up from the airline IDR based on three primary variables: 1) the affirmation factor (0-2 notches) 2) the presence of a liquidity facility (0-1 notch), and 3) recovery prospects (0-1 notch).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Other than the class A certificates in the 2014-2 and 2014-1 transactions, all of the class A certificates are rated either 'BBB+' or 'BBB'. These certificates have received +2 notches of uplift for a high affirmation factor and a +1 notch uplift for a liquidity facility. The 2016-2 transaction is rated 'BBB', and it is the only class A certificate that received a zero-notch adjustment for average recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 2019-2, 2019-1, 2018-1, 2016-1, and 2013-1 certificates are rated 'BBB+' and received a +1 notch adjustment for superior recovery prospects. United's 2016-1 and 2016-2 transactions are quite similar in terms of underlying collateral. The rating differential between United's 2016-1 and 2016-2 class A certificates is driven partly by slower scheduled amortization and higher widebody exposure for 2016-2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class B Certificate Ratings: United's class B certificates are also derived through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom up approach and are rated either 'BBB' or 'BBB-'. All of the class B certificates have received +2 notches uplift for a high affirmation factor and a +1 notch uplift for the presence of a liquidity facility. The 2018-1 transaction is rated 'BBB-', and it is the only class B certificate that received a zero-notch adjustment for average recovery prospects. United's 2019-2, 2016-2, and 2016-1 class B certificates are rated 'BBB-' and received a -1 notch adjustment for poor recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Tiers: United's EETC transactions are secured by the 787-8, 787-9, 737-900ER, 737 MAX 9, 777-300ERs, and E175s. Tier classifications for each of these aircraft types are unchanged from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior review. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the 787-8, 787-9, and 737-800 to be tier 1 aircraft. The 737-800 is prior generation technology, but it is the workhorse of the industry, with a very large in-service fleet and operator base (~280). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that replacement of the 737-800 will be slow due to delivery delays of new aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 787-8 is equipped with new generation technology, with a mid-sized fleet (~350), limited order backlog (~31) and modest operator base (~53). Its engine commonality with the 787 family, and the potential for replacement demand for A330s keeps it in Tier 1. The 787-9 has remained in Tier 1 as it is the best-in-class aircraft with a reasonable fleet size (~575) and a growing order backlog. The remaining aircraft in United's EETCs are considered tier 2 due to limited user bases and backlogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Affirmation Factor: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has assigned the maximum notching of '+2' to subordinated tranches for affirmation. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s views on transaction-specific affirmation factors are consistent with prior reviews, and this maximum affirmation factor is driven by the collateral pools for these transactions, which we believe are highly likely to be affirmed in a bankruptcy scenario as they comprise of aircraft that is essential to United's fleet strategy. Delays in aircraft delivery from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> (BBB/Negative) and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> (A-/Positive) further underscores the importance of these aircraft to United's fleet. We continue to believe that United would not reject the newer aircraft in the event of a bankruptcy but would offload leased aircraft first. As of YE 2023, the company leased 133 aircraft which include older, less fuel efficient A319s, A320s, 737s, 757s, 787s and 777-200ERs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'BB' rating is two notches above American Airlines (B+/Stable). The rating differential is partially driven by United's total debt burden, which remains lower than American's, along with a higher liquidity balance. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes United has lower de-leveraging capacity and greater execution risk relative to American, due to the company's capital spending and fleet renewal program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United is two notches below <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> (BBB-/Stable), with the difference driven by United's higher gross leverage. Delta also benefits from higher operating margins and pre-pandemic track record of FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EETCs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The certificates rated 'A+' are in line with other class 'AA' certificates in certain American Airlines transactions and one notch higher than ratings for several class A certificates issued by other carriers. Stress scenario LTVs for the 2019-2, 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions remain low and continue to support the 'A+' rating. Class A certificates that are rated 'A' compare well with issuances from American and <span class="companylink">Air Canada</span> that are also rated 'A'. Rating similarities are driven by similar levels of overcollateralization and high-quality pools of collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Certificates rated at 'BBB+', 'BBB' or 'BBB-' are notched up from United's IDR through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom-up approach. The four-notch uplift for transactions rated 'BBB+' is higher than transactions issued by American Airlines (B+/Stable) despite the latter receiving maximum notching (+5) due to the differential in issuer default rating. Certificates rated 'BBB' or 'BBB-' receive less uplift compared to similar transactions from other issuers due to weaker recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--United's capacity grows in the low to mid-single digits percentage range annually;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued travel demand growth keeps load factors in the 83%-84% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat to modestly increasing unit revenues;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Jet fuel prices averaging around $2.65/gallon throughout the forecast, implying Brent crude prices in the mid-$70/barrel range, while crack spreads remain moderately above historical averages;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending in line with the company's public guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EETCs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include a harsh downside scenario in which United declares bankruptcy, chooses to reject the collateral aircraft, and where the aircraft are remarketed in the midst of a severe slump in aircraft values. A <b>United Airlines</b> bankruptcy is hypothetical, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not currently expect such a scenario, as indicated by United's 'BB' IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s models also incorporate a full draw on liquidity facilities and include assumptions for repossession and remarketing costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery analyses for subordinated tranches utilize our 'BB' level stress tests and include a full draw on liquidity facilities and assumptions for repossessions and remarketing costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis incorporates a 6% annual depreciation rate for Tier I aircraft and a 7% annual depreciation rate for Tier II aircraft. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has increased its depreciation rate assumptions modestly reflecting updated analysis of historical aircraft value trends;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--'A' level stresses incorporate a 25% haircut for 787-9 and 737-800 aircraft, a 30% haircut for 737 MAX 9, and 787-8 aircraft and a 35% haircut for 777-300ER, 737-900ER, ERJ 175, and 787-10 aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 3.5x or EBITDAR fixed-charge coverage sustained below 3.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained below 3.0x and EBITDAR fixed-charge coverage above 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained positive FCF generation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstration of continued improvement in unit revenues;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Progress towards United's fleet renewal efforts while maintaining financial flexibility, including maintaining or increasing unencumbered assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EETCs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Top-down approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA certificates and the 2014-2 and 2014-1 class A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Therefore, a negative rating action could be driven by an unexpected decline in collateral values. All the class AA certificates remain well overcollateralized, and therefore negative actions based on declining aircraft values are less likely. Collateral coverage for the 2014-2 and 2014-1 class A certificates is less robust. Modest value declines could drive a one-notch downgrade for either transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Bottom-up approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's remaining EETC tranches are notched off of United's IDR. Tranches rated 'BBB+' or 'BBB' are sensitive to recovery expectations in a stress scenario. Declining asset values could drive weaker recovery prospects, leading to further downgrades. Subordinate tranches are also subject to changes in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of the likelihood of affirmation for the underlying collateral. In addition, tranches rated through the bottom up approach would be subject to downgrade should <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> downgrade United's corporate rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Top-down approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA certificates and the 2014-2 and 2014-1 class A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Positive rating actions are less likely for the remaining tranches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Bottom-up approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's remaining EETC tranches are notched off of United's IDR, and the tranches would move with any changes to the IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's YE 2024 cash and short-term investments totaled $14.5 billion and $2.97 billion available under its revolver, equivalent to 31% of United's LTM revenue. United's liquidity balance was higher than either of its major peers, and provides a material amount of protection against potential economic pressure. Pre-pandemic, United targeted a minimum of $5 billion-$6 billion in total liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company's current liquidity balance and improving operating cash flows to be more than sufficient to cover near-term obligations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United to direct cash towards aircraft deliveries and scheduled debt maturities. As such, unencumbered assets are expected to rise through the forecast period, rebuilding after United utilized much of its unencumbered asset base to raise funds during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's upcoming debt maturities are sizeable but manageable. Principal repayments total $2.9 billion in 2025, $4.8 billion in 2026, and $2.3 billion in 2027. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects maturities to be met through a combination of cash generated from operations, drawing down the current cash balance, and financing upcoming aircraft deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's debt structure primarily consists of aircraft backed EETCs, secured term loan and notes backed by the company's slots/gates/routes collateral, and a secured note backed by its loyalty program. United also has a number of unsecured obligations that arose as part of the government Payroll Support Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also rates a series of special facility revenue bonds guaranteed by United. Funds from the bonds financed the construction of a multi-terminal baggage handling system, tenant and other improvements at International passenger terminal (Terminal E) and related airport facilities for use by United (formerly <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span>) at George H. Bush International Airport/Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Although the revenue bonds benefit from a security interest in United's lease payments, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the risk profile of these revenue bonds as closer to United's unsecured issuances. United does not have a master lease at Houston International Airport. Instead, United has multiple leases in place tied to various terminals and facilities. In a bankruptcy scenario, it is possible select leases could take priority and leave other leases to be rejected or consolidated. As such, we rate these revenue bonds at 'BB/RR4' in line with United's unsecured debt ratings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-08 November 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BB-' rating with a Recovery Rating of 'RR4' to proposed special facility revenue bonds to be issued by the city of Houston and guaranteed by <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b> Holdings, Inc.</span> (BB-).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The city intends to issue the bonds to finance design and construction of certain facilities in Terminal B at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The bonds do not constitute indebtedness to the city of Houston or the airport and neither are liable for any payments. The bonds are secured by a pledge of certain revenues, consisting primarily of net rentals to be paid by United pursuant to a lease between Houston and United.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> rates <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b>, Inc.</span> 'BB-' with a Positive Rating Outlook. This reflects expected credit metric improvements, solid financial performance, debt reduction, substantial liquidity and financial flexibility. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also anticipates benefits from capacity constraints at struggling low-cost competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings Aligned With Unsecured Debt: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> rates United's Houston revenue bond in line with its unsecured issuances. United lacks a master lease at Houston International Airport, instead having multiple leases tied to various terminals and facilities. In bankruptcy, some leases may take priority, leaving others to be rejected or consolidated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The city of Houston must make commercially reasonable efforts to re-let the facilities if United defaults, but re-leasing risks are likely higher compared to capacity-constrained airports. These risks are mitigated by the strategic importance of United's Houston hub, its fourth-largest domestic hub, accounting for 20% of United's system-wide passenger enplanements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Metrics Improving: United's credit metrics are improving due to debt prepayment, positive results from strategic initiatives, lower fuel prices, and a healthy operating environment. EBTIDAR leverage ended the third quarter at 3.9x, down from over 6x at YE 2022, aided by term loan prepayments totaling over USD3.5 billion in 2024. United has reduced its gross debt to $33.4 billion from a peak of over $41 billion during the pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case forecasts leverage will decline toward the mid- to low 3x range over the next one to two years on modestly declining debt balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >There is potential upside to the forecast if United hits its margin expansion goals, compared to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for flat near-term margins. United retains elevated liquidity, resulting in net metrics roughly in line with higher-rated <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span>, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Delta to produce better FCF over the next several years. United aims to reduce net leverage below 2x over the next few years, down from 2.7x at 3Q23. EBITDAR fixed charge coverage has also improved to the mid-3x range, near <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s positive rating sensitivity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects incremental EBITDAR coverage improvement going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Constructive Environment: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that demand for air travel will remain healthy into 2025, as evidenced by recent reports of solid booking trends through the fourth quarter and the ongoing improvement in business and premium travel. Although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects slower U.S. economic growth next year, consumers are likely to continue prioritizing travel spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects airline pricing power to be supported by limits on seat supply due to reduced capacity by domestic carriers and by original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production delays and engine maintenance issues. Examples include Southwest's commitment to limit capacity growth to 1%-2% and <span class="companylink">Spirit</span>'s expectations for reduced capacity next year. However, cost inflation remains a headwind. Unit cost increases have outpaced unit revenues this year, driven by higher labor rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Steady Profitability with Potential Upside: Profit margins are down modestly this year but have performed well compared with peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects flat or slightly increasing margins in the next few years. Although margins would remain below pre-pandemic levels, they will generate sufficient cash flows and continued improving credit metrics over time. In addition, there is potential upside to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast. Recent industry capacity restraint and benefits from the company's ongoing United Next program may lead to more significant unit revenue gains in 2025 compared to the modest growth in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast, potentially supporting further positive rating actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Program-Linked FCF Profile: Capital spending is expected to be less intense than previously anticipated in 2024 and 2025 due to aircraft delivery delays. These delays will be exacerbated by the ongoing <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> strike and certification delays for the MAX 10. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> now expects United to generate more than $1 billion in FCF in 2024 and roughly neutral FCF over the next three years. United management now emphasizes FCF generation even as it works through its fleet renewal, suggesting a keener focus on preserving and improving its financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United Next Benefits to Be Realized: United is benefiting from its "United Next" fleet renewal plan, with significant improvement still to come. By the end of the third quarter, the company had firm commitments for 686 aircraft to be delivered through 2033, equal to more than 70% of its current mainline fleet count. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes this fleet transformation will positively impact United's cost structure and competitive position in domestic markets. The new aircraft will be significantly more fuel- efficient, both in engine technology and seats per departure. This renewal is particularly impactful for United's regional operations, which rely heavily on small, inefficient regional jets compared to competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'BB-' rating is one notch above <span class="companylink">American Airlines Group Inc.</span> (B+/Stable). The rating differential is driven in part by United's total debt burden, which remains lower than American's, along with a higher liquidity balance. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes United has lower de-leveraging capacity and greater execution risk relative to American, due to the company's capital spending and fleet renewal program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United is three notches below <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> (BBB-/Stable), with the difference driven by United's higher gross leverage. Delta also benefits from higher operating margins and pre-pandemic track record of FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--United's capacity grows around 7% in 2024 and in the low to mid-single digits annually thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued travel demand growth keeps load factors in the 83%-84% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat to modestly increasing unit revenues;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Jet fuel prices averaging around $2.80/gallon in 2024, implying Brent crude prices in the mid-$70/barrel range, while crack spreads remain above historical averages;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending in line with the company's public guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending to 3.5x and EBITDAR fixed-charge coverage toward 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Neutral to positive sustained FCF;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins maintained in the mid-teens or better;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Progress toward United's fleet renewal efforts while maintaining financial flexibility, including maintaining or increasing unencumbered assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 4.5x or FFO fixed-charge coverage sustained below 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Provides Downside Protection: United's 3Q24 cash and short-term investments totaled $14.1 billion and $2.97 billion available under its revolver, equivalent to 31% of United's LTM revenue. United's liquidity balance was higher than either of its major peers, and provides a material amount of protection against potential economic pressure. Pre-pandemic, United targeted a minimum of $5 billion to $6 billion in total liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company's current liquidity balance and improving operating cash flows to be more than sufficient to cover near-term obligations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United to direct cash toward aircraft deliveries and scheduled debt maturities. As such, unencumbered assets are expected to rise through the forecast period, rebuilding after United utilized much of its unencumbered asset base to raise funds during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Structure: United's upcoming debt maturities are sizable but manageable. Principal repayments will total $3 billion in 2025, $4.8 billion in 2026 and $2.3 billion in 2027. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects maturities to be met through a combination of cash generated from operations, drawing down the current cash balance, and financing upcoming aircraft deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's debt structure primarily consists of aircraft backed EETCs, secured term loan and notes backed by the company's slots/gates/routes collateral, and a secured note backed by its loyalty program. United has a limited amount of unsecured notes as well as unsecured obligations that arose as part of the government Payroll Support Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Revenue Bonds: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also rates a series of special facility revenue bonds guaranteed by United. Funds from the bonds financed the construction of a multi-terminal baggage handling system, tenant and other improvements at International passenger terminal (Terminal E) and related airport facilities for use by United (formerly <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span>) at George Bush Intercontinental Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Although the revenue bonds benefit from a security interest in United's lease payments, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the risk profile of these revenue bonds as closer to United's unsecured issuances. United does not have a master lease at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Instead, United has multiple leases in place tied to various terminals and facilities. In a bankruptcy scenario, it is possible select leases could take priority and leave other leases to be rejected or consolidated. As such, we rate these revenue bonds at 'BB-'/'RR4' in line with United's unsecured debt ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> is one of the largest airlines in the world. The company maintains hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, <span class="companylink">Denver International Airport</span>, George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, and <span class="companylink">Los Angeles International Airport</span>, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-04 November 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has revised <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> Rating Outlook to Positive from Stable and has affirmed its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Positive Outlook reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations for continued credit metric improvement and solid financial performance relative to peers. The company is paying down debt while maintaining substantial liquidity and financial flexibility. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also believes United will benefit from capacity constraints at struggling low-cost competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's considerable multi-year capital spending program and pressured FCF remain rating concerns. However, expected aircraft delivery delays should ease the company's capital spending in the forecast compared to prior estimates. United's substantial financial flexibility, provided by its liquidity and unencumbered assets, help temper concerns around upcoming capital spending commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has revised the recovery ratings of United's senior secured facilities to 'BB+' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR1' from 'BB+'/'RR2'. The change is driven by the large reduction in outstanding MileagePlus debt, which has a priority claim on royalty-related cashflows. The recovery rating is also supported by the expectation that gross leverage will decline through debt repayment over the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Metrics Improving: United's credit metrics are improving due to debt prepayment, positive results from strategic initiatives, lower fuel prices, and a healthy operating environment. EBTIDAR leverage ended the third quarter at 3.9x, down from over 6x at YE 2022, aided by term loan prepayments totaling over USD3.5 billion in 2024. United has reduced its gross debt to $33.4 billion from a peak of over $41 billion during the pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case forecasts leverage will decline toward the mid-to-low 3x range over the next one to two years on modestly declining debt balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >There is potential upside to the forecast if United hits its margin expansion goals, compared to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for flat near-term margins. United retains elevated liquidity, resulting in net metrics roughly in line with higher-rated <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span>, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Delta to produce better FCF over the next several years. United aims to reduce net leverage below 2x over the next few years, down from 2.7x at 3Q23. EBITDAR fixed charge coverage has also improved to the mid-3x range, near <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s positive rating sensitivity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects incremental EBITDAR coverage improvement going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Constructive Environment: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that demand for air travel will remain healthy into 2025, sd evidenced by recent reports of solid booking trends through the fourth quarter and the ongoing improvement in business and premium travel. Although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects slower U.S. economic growth next year, consumers are likely to continue prioritizing travel spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects airline pricing power to be supported by limits on seat supply due to reduced capacity by domestic carriers and by original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production delays and engine maintenance issues. Examples include Southwest's commitment to limit capacity growth to 1%-2% and <span class="companylink">Spirit</span>'s expectations for reduced capacity next year. However, cost inflation remains a headwind. Unit cost increases have outpaced unit revenues this year, driven by higher labor rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Steady Profitability with Potential Upside: Profit margins are down modestly this year but have performed well compared with peers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects flat or slightly increasing margins in the next few years. Although margins would remain below pre-pandemic levels, they will generate sufficient cash flows and continued improving credit metrics over time. Additionally, there is potential upside to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast. Recent industry capacity restraint and benefits from United's ongoing United Next program may lead to more significant unit revenue gains in 2025 compared to the modest growth in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast, potentially supporting further positive rating actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Program-Linked FCF Profile: Capital spending is expected to be less intense than previously anticipated in 2024 and 2025 due to aircraft delivery delays. These delays will be exacerbated by the ongoing <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> strike and certification delays for the MAX 10. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> now expects United to generate more than $1 billion in FCF in 2024 and roughly neutral FCF over the next three years. United management now emphasizes FCF generation even as it works through its fleet renewal, suggesting a keener focus on preserving and improving its financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United Next Benefits To Be Realized: United is benefiting from its "United Next" fleet renewal plan, with significant improvement still to come. By the end of the third quarter, the company had firm commitments for 686 aircraft to be delivered through 2033, equal to more than 70% of its current mainline fleet count. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes this fleet transformation will positively impact United's cost structure and competitive position in domestic markets. The new aircraft will be significantly more fuel- efficient, both in engine technology and seats per departure. This renewal is particularly impactful for United's regional operations, which rely heavily on small, inefficient regional jets compared to competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'BB-' rating is one notch above <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> (B+/Stable). The rating differential is driven, in part, by United's total debt burden, which remains lower than American's, along with a higher liquidity balance. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes United has lower de-leveraging capacity and greater execution risk relative to American, due to the company's capital spending and fleet renewal program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United is three notches below <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> (BBB-/Stable), with the difference driven by United's higher gross leverage. Delta also benefits from higher operating margins and pre-pandemic track record of FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--United's capacity grows around 7% in 2024 and in the low to mid-single digits annually thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued travel demand growth keeps load factors in the 83%-84% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat to modestly increasing unit revenues;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Jet fuel prices averaging around $2.80/gallon in 2024, implying Brent crude prices in the mid-$70/barrel range, while crack spreads remain above historical averages;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending in line with the company's public guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually Or Collectively, Lead To Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending to 3.5x and EBITDAR fixed-charge coverage towards 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Neutral to positive sustained FCF;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins maintained in the mid-teens or better</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Progress towards United's fleet renewal efforts while maintaining financial flexibility, including maintaining or increasing unencumbered assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually Or Collectively, Lead To Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 4.5x or FFO fixed-charge coverage sustained below 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Provides Downside Protection: United's 3Q24 cash and short-term investments totaled $14.1 billion and $2.97 billion available under its revolver, equivalent to 31% of United's LTM revenue. United's liquidity balance was higher than either of its major peers, and provides a material amount of protection against potential economic pressure. Pre-pandemic, United targeted a minimum of $5 billion-$6 billion in total liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company's current liquidity balance and improving operating cash flows to be more than sufficient to cover near-term obligations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United to direct cash towards aircraft deliveries and scheduled debt maturities. As such, unencumbered assets are expected to rise through the forecast period, rebuilding after United utilized much of its unencumbered asset base to raise funds during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Structure: United's upcoming debt maturities are sizeable but manageable. Principal repayments total $3 billion in 2025, $4.8 billion in 2026 and $2.3 billion in 2027. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects maturities to be met through a combination of cash generated from operations, drawing down the current cash balance, and financing upcoming aircraft deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's debt structure primarily consists of aircraft backed EETCs, secured term loan and notes backed by the company's slots/gates/routes collateral, and a secured note backed by its loyalty program. United has a limited amount of unsecured notes as well as unsecured obligations that arose as part of the government Payroll Support Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Revenue Bonds: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also rates a series of special facility revenue bonds guaranteed by United. Funds from the bonds financed the construction of a multi-terminal baggage handling system, tenant and other improvements at International passenger terminal (Terminal E) and related airport facilities for use by United (formerly <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span>) at George H. Bush International Airport/Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Although the revenue bonds benefit from a security interest in United's lease payments, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the risk profile of these revenue bonds as closer to United's unsecured issuances. United does not have a master lease at Houston International Airport. Instead, United has multiple leases in place tied to various terminals and facilities. In a bankruptcy scenario, it is possible select leases could take priority and leave other leases to be rejected or consolidated. As such, we rate these revenue bonds at 'BB-/RR4' in line with United's unsecured debt ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> is one of the largest airlines in the world. The company maintains hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, <span class="companylink">Denver International Airport</span>, George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, and <span class="companylink">Los Angeles International Airport</span>, among others.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>United Airlines</b> 2014-2:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$455.4 million class A certificates due in 2026 affirmed at 'A'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>United Airlines</b> 2014-1:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$380.6 million class A certificates due in 2025 upgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Continental 2012-2:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$357.8 million class A certificates due in 2024 affirmed at 'BBB'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The positive rating actions are primarily driven by a one-notch upgrade to <b>United Airlines</b>' issuer default rating to 'BB-' from 'B+'. The affirmations for tranches rated through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s top-down approach are driven by loan-to-value (LTV) ratios that continue to support the existing ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's AA tranches and its 2014-2, 2014-1 and 2012-2 class A tranches are rated through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s top-down approach, and are based off of transaction LTVs in stress scenarios. Under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' level scenario, LTV's improved by about 0.5% to 3% for all of United's EETCs due to the collateral pools depreciating in the mid-single digits, within our tier 1 and tier 2 depreciation assumptions of 6% and 7% respectively. LTVs for the 2014-1 transaction improved sufficiently to support an upgrade to 'A-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pressured widebody values drove higher LTVs for multiple United transactions through the pandemic, but values have stabilized over the past year. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects widebody values to remain steady driven by growing international travel, limited production capacity on newer widebodies and uncertainty around timing of the 777x entry into service. LTVs increased in the 2022 review due to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s reclassification of certain aircraft from tier 1 to tier 2, but have stabilized since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's remaining tranches are rated through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom-up approach and are based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s assessment of an affirmation factor, or essentiality of the fleet to the airline, along recovery prospects in a stress scenario. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s assessment of the affirmation factors within the pools are unchanged from the prior review, as United's fleet renewal is largely in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United IDR Upgrade: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> upgraded United's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB'- from 'B+' on February 12. The IDR upgrade reflects United's improving credit metrics (FY23 EBITDAR leverage at 4x, and meaningfully lower net leverage) and planned gross debt repayment resulting in gross leverage forecasted to trend in the mid-3x range over the next one to two years, while preserving and growing its financial flexibility. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also believes that the company's diverse route network and product offerings drive a better competitive position against the currently struggling domestic low-cost carriers. United also stands to benefit from its ongoing fleet renewal mainly due to increased average gauge and better fuel efficiency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class AA Rating Updates: The affirmation of United's class AA certificates for the 2019-2, 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions at 'A+' is supported by strong LTVs in the low-to-mid 80% range, which gives them material headroom within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' stress scenario. The class AA certificates for the 2016-2 and the 2016-1 transaction are affirmed at 'A', where they continue to pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' stress scenario with LTVs the mid 80% range. The 2016-2 and 2016-1 transactions were downgraded in 2022 reflecting softening LTVs driven by depreciating 777-300ER values, a greater percentage of the collateral pool comprising of Tier 2 aircraft, and high widebody exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class A Updates: The upgrades for certain class A certificates are driven by the upgrade to the <b>United Airlines</b> IDR. The 2014-1 upgrade to 'A-' from 'BBB+' was driven by improving LTVs that now pass the 'A' level stress scenario due to a more aggressive amortization schedule than most of UAL's EETCs. Moreover, the aircraft in this transaction have declined in the low-to-mid single digits, which is less than our assumptions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 aircraft at 6% and 7% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Loan-to-value ratios for United's remaining transactions do not pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'BBB' Stress test, and according to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, are rated via a bottom up approach and notched off of United's IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom-up approach calls for ratings to be notched up from the airline IDR based on three primary variables: 1) the affirmation factor (0-3 notches) 2) the presence of a liquidity facility, (0-1 notch) and 3) recovery prospects (0-1 notch).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Besides the class A certificates in the 2014-1 transaction, all of the class A certificates are rated either 'BBB' or 'BBB-'. These certificates have received +2 notches uplift for a high affirmation factor and a +1 notch uplift for the presence of a liquidity facility. The 2016-2 transaction is rated 'BBB-', and is the only class A certificate that received a zero-notch adjustment for average recovery prospects. United's 2019-2, 2019-1, 2018-1 and 2016-1 certificates are rated 'BBB' and received a +1 notch adjustment for superior recovery prospects. United's 2016-1 and 2016-2 transactions are quite similar in terms of underlying collateral. The rating differential between United's 2016-1 and 2016-2 class A certificates is driven partly by slower scheduled amortization and higher widebody exposure for 2016-2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class B Certificate Ratings: United's class B certificates are also derived through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom up approach and are rated either 'BBB-' or 'BB+'. All of the class B certificates have received +2 notches uplift for a high affirmation factor and a +1 notch uplift for the presence of a liquidity facility. The 2018-1 transaction is rated 'BBB-', and is the only class B certificate that received a zero-notch adjustment for average recovery prospects. United's 2019-2, 2016-2, and 2016-1 class B certificates are rated 'BB+' and received a -1 notch adjustment for poor recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Tiers: United's EETC transactions are secured by the 787 family of aircraft, the 737-900ER, 737 MAX 9, 777-300ERs, and E175s. Tier classifications for each of these aircraft types are unchanged from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior review. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the 787-8, 787-9, and 737-800 to be tier 1 aircraft. The B737-800 is prior generation technology, but it is the workhorse of the industry, with a very large in-service fleet and operator base (~240), and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that replacement of the B737-800 will be slow due to delivery delays of new aircraft. The B787-8 is a new generation technology, with a mid-sized fleet (~350), limited order backlog (~35) and modest operator base (~45). Its engine commonality with the 787 family, and the potential for replacement demand for A330s keeps it in Tier 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Lastly, the B787-9 has remained in Tier 1 as it is the best in class aircraft with a reasonable fleet size (~575) and a growing order backlog. The remaining aircraft in United's EETCs are considered tier 2 due to limited user bases and backlogs. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> re-classified the B737-900ER, B737-MAX 9, B787-10 and the E175 aircraft to tier 2 from tier 1 in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Affirmation Factor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With the upgrade to United's IDR to 'BB-' from 'B+', the maximum affirmation factor notching compressed to +2 from +3. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has assigned the maximum of '+2' notching to subordinated tranches for affirmation. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s views on transaction specific affirmation factors are consistent with prior reviews, and this maximum affirmation factor is driven by the collateral pools for these transactions, which we believe are highly likely to be affirmed in a bankruptcy scenario as they comprise of aircraft that is essential to United's fleet strategy. We also continue to believe that United would not reject the newer aircraft in the event of a bankruptcy, but rather offload leased aircraft first. As of YE 2022, the company leased 136 aircraft which include older, less full efficient A319s, A320s, 737s, 757s, 787s and 777-200ERs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The certificates rated 'A+' are in line with other class 'AA' certificates in certain <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> transactions and one notch higher than ratings for several class A certificates issued by other carriers. Stress scenario LTVs for the 2019-2, 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions remain low and continue to support the 'A+' rating. Class A certificates that are rated 'A' compare well with issuances from American and <span class="companylink">Air Canada</span> that are also rated 'A'. Rating similarities are driven by similar levels of overcollateralization and high-quality pools of collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Certificates rated at 'BBB', 'BBB-' or 'BB+' are notched up from United's IDR through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom up approach. The four-notch uplift for transactions rated 'BBB' is one notch lower than certain similar transactions issued by <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span>, which benefit from higher affirmation factor notching. Certificates rated 'BBB-' or 'BB+' receive less ratings uplift compared to similar transactions from other issuers due to weaker recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include a harsh downside scenario in which United declares bankruptcy, chooses to reject the collateral aircraft, and where the aircraft are remarketed in the midst of a severe slump in aircraft values. A <b>United Airlines</b> bankruptcy is hypothetical, and is not <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current expectation as reflected in United's 'BB-' IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s models also incorporate a full draw on liquidity facilities and include assumptions for repossession and remarketing costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery analyses for subordinated tranches utilize our 'BB' level stress tests and include a full draw on liquidity facilities and assumptions for repossessions and remarketing costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis incorporates a 6% annual depreciation rate for Tier I aircraft and a 7% annual depreciation rate for Tier II aircraft. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has increased its depreciation rate assumptions modestly reflecting updated analysis of historical aircraft value trends;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--'A' level stresses incorporate a 25% haircut for 787-9 and 737-800 aircraft, a 30% haircut for 737 MAX 9, and 787-8 aircraft and a 35% haircut for 777-300ER, 737-900ER, ERJ 175, and 787-10 aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Top-down approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA certificates and the 2014-2, 2014-1 and 2012-2 class A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Positive rating actions are less likely for the remaining tranches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Bottom-up approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's remaining EETC tranches are notched off of United's IDR, and the tranches would move with any changes to the IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Top-down approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA certificates and the 2014-2, 2014-1 and 2012-2 class A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Therefore, a negative rating action could be driven by an unexpected decline in collateral values. All the class AA certificates remain well overcollateralized, and therefore negative actions based on declining aircraft values are less likely. Collateral coverage for the 2014-2 and 2014-1 class A certificates is less robust. Modest value declines could drive a one-notch downgrade for either transaction. The 2012-2 certificates mature in April 2025, and so negative rating action to this transaction is unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Bottom-up approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's remaining EETC tranches are notched off of United's IDR. Tranches rated 'BBB' or 'BBB-' and are sensitive to recovery expectations in a stress scenario. Declining asset values could drive weaker recovery prospects, leading to further downgrades. Subordinate tranches are also subject to changes in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of the likelihood of affirmation for the underlying collateral. In addition, tranches rated through the bottom up approach would be subject to downgrade should <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> downgrade United's corporate rating.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-12 February 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b> Holdings, Inc.</span> (United) and its primary operating subsidiary, <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b>, Inc.</span>'s Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to 'BB-' from 'B+'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also rates the proposed term loan 'BB+'/'RR2' with proceeds used to refinance a portion of the outstanding term loan. Additionally, the agency has upgraded United's senior secured debt ratings to 'BB+'/'RR2' from 'BB'/'RR2' and unsecured debt ratings and industrial revenue bonds to 'BB-'/'RR4' from 'B-'/'RR6'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The IDR upgrade reflects United's improving credit metrics and planned gross debt repayment, while preserving and growing its financial flexibility. EBITDAR leverage ended 2023 at 4x, in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior positive rating sensitivity, while net leverage was meaningfully lower as the company continues to hold a substantial cash balance. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case forecasts United's gross leverage to trend into the mid-3x range over the next one year-two years consistent with 'BB-' rating tolerances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also believes that the company's diverse route network and product offerings drive a better competitive position against the currently struggling domestic low-cost carriers. Another consideration is that United stands to benefit from its ongoing fleet renewal mainly due to increased average gauge and better fuel efficiency. The unsecured debt ratings upgrade mainly reflects the expected reduction in secured debt and growing unencumbered asset base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's considerable multi-year capital spending program and pressured FCF remain concerns. However, aircraft delivery delays are expected to ease the company's capital spending burden in coming years compared to prior estimates. Substantial financial flexibility provided by United's liquidity and unencumbered assets serve to temper concerns around upcoming capital spending commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Facility Amendment: United plans to amend its existing senior secured credit facility; upsizing its revolver to $2.7 billion from $1.75 billion and repaying a portion of its outstanding term loan while extending its maturity from April 2025 to February 2029. An incremental $165 million of commitments that is not extending its maturity will be available until April 2025. The planned transaction supports the retention of financial flexibility following management's expected gross debt repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Metrics Improving: United's credit metrics improved significantly over the course of 2023 driven by a healthy operating environment, lower fuel prices, and a resurgence in international demand. EBTIDAR leverage ended the year at 4x, down from over 6x at YE 2022. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case forecasts leverage will decline towards the mid-3x range over the next one year-two years driven by relatively stable operating margins and modest top line growth. Gross debt is expected to decline modestly following planned debt repayments, which could be offset by potential financing transactions to fund upcoming aircraft deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United continues to retain elevated liquidity, driving net metrics that are roughly in line with higher-rated <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span>, though <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects cash to come down over time as United works through its fleet renewal program. EBITDAR fixed charge coverage has also improved to more than 3x, above our prior positive rating sensitivity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects incremental EBITDAR coverage improvement going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Constructive Environment: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that demand for air travel will remain healthy through 2024, evidenced by recent reports of solid booking trends through the fourth quarter and the potential for improvement in business travel. Although we expect slower U.S. economic growth next year, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Global Economic Outlook no longer anticipates a U.S. recession. Consumer resilience is likely to continue to include prioritizing spend on travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Airline pricing power should remain broadly supported by limits on global seat supply driven by original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production delays and engine maintenance issues. However, inflationary pressure on consumer spending, overcapacity in certain markets, and the potential for weaker international travel following a resurgence in 2023 present downside risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Profitability: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects margins for United to remain roughly flat in 2024. A healthy demand environment and modestly lower jet fuel prices are being offset by a number of headwinds. US Airlines are contending with higher costs, particularly for labor and maintenance, slower macroeconomic growth, potential consumer weakness, and persistent supply chain constraints. Like most competitors, United's pilots ratified a new labor agreement in 2023 that calls for compensation increases of up to 40% over four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Geopolitical tensions and their potential impact on fuel prices also raise concerns. However, these challenges are offset by a number of positives, including benefits to be gained from United's fleet initiatives (driving higher gauge, improving premium seating, better fuel efficiency, etc.), and more normalized operations following a period of re-building after the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Program-Linked FCF Profile: Capital spending is expected to be less intense than previously anticipated in 2024 and 2025 due to aircraft delivery delays. Delays will be exacerbated by recent issues with the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 737 MAX 9 and subsequent delays in certification for the MAX 10. Nevertheless, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to remain negative over the next several years as United goes through a period of significant fleet renewal and expansion. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case currently anticipates negative FCF of roughly $1 billion in 2024. United management has recently emphasized FCF generation even as it works through its fleet renewal suggesting a keener focus on preserving and possibly improving its financial flexibility. Expectations for ongoing negative FCF has been an overhang on United's ratings, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> would view progress toward reversing this trend as supportive of further positive rating momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United Next Benefits To Be Realized: United is seeing benefits from its "United Next" fleet renewal plan, with the bulk of the planned improvement still to come. At the end of the third quarter, the company's orderbook included firm commitments for 749 aircraft to be delivered through 2033, equal to more than 85% of its current mainline fleet count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that United's fleet transformation will have a material positive impact on United's cost structure and on its competitive position in domestic markets. The aircraft on order will be significantly more fuel efficient both in terms of engine technology and in seats per departure. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the fleet renewal as particularly impactful for United's regional operations, where it remains much more heavily reliant on small, inefficient regional jets compared to competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'BB-' rating is one notch above <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> (B+/Stable). The rating differential is driven, in part, by United's total debt burden which remains lower than American's along with a higher liquidity balance. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views United as having lower de-leveraging capacity and greater execution risk relative to American due to the company's capital spending and fleet renewal program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United is two notches below <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> (BB+/Positive), with the difference driven by higher gross leverage at United. Delta also benefits from higher operating margins and pre-pandemic track record of FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--United's capacity grows around 7% in 2024 and in the low to mid-single digits annually thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued travel demand growth keeps load factors in the 83%-84% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat to modestly increasing unit revenues;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Jet fuel prices averaging around $2.80/gallon in 2024, implying Brent crude prices in the low-$80/barrel range, while crack spreads remain above historical averages;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending in line with the company's public guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending to 3.5x and EBITDAR fixed-charge towards 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Neutral to positive sustained FCF;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins maintained in the mid-teens or better</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Progress towards United's fleet renewal efforts while maintaining financial flexibility, including maintaining or increasing unencumbered assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 4.5x or FFO fixed charge coverage sustained below 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Provides Downside Protection: United ended 4Q23 with cash and short-term investments totaling $14.4 billion and $1.75 billion available under its revolver, equivalent to 30% of United's LTM revenue. United's liquidity balance was higher than either of its major peers, and provides a material amount of protection against potential economic pressure. Prior to COVID, United targeted a minimum of $5 billion-$6 billion in total liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company's current liquidity balance, along with improving operating cash flows, to be sufficient to cover near-term obligations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United to direct a portion of its cash towards aircraft deliveries and upcoming debt maturities. As such, unencumbered assets are expected to rise through our forecast period, rebuilding after United utilized much of its unencumbered asset base to raise funds during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Structure: United's upcoming debt maturities are sizeable but manageable, including $3.9 billion in 2024, $3.4 billion in 2025 and $5.2 billion in 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects maturities to be met through a combination of cash generated from operations, drawing down the current cash balance, and financing upcoming aircraft deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's debt structure primarily consists of aircraft backed EETCs, secured term loans and notes backed by the company's slots/gates/routes collateral, and secured notes and term loan backed by its loyalty program. United has a limited amount of unsecured notes as well as unsecured obligations that arose as part of the government Payroll Support Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Revenue Bonds: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also rates a series of special facility revenue bonds guaranteed by United. Funds from the bonds financed the construction of a multi-terminal baggage handling system, tenant and other improvements at International passenger terminal (Terminal E) and related airport facilities for use by United (formerly <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span>) at George H. Bush International Airport/Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Although the revenue bonds benefit from a security interest in United's lease payments, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the risk profile of these revenue bonds as closer to United's unsecured issuances. United does not have a master lease at Houston International Airport. Instead, United has multiple leases in place tied to various terminals and facilities. In a bankruptcy scenario, it is possible select leases could take priority and leave other leases to be rejected or consolidated. As such, we rate these revenue bonds in line with United's unsecured debt ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-11 April 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b> Holdings, Inc</span>. and its primary operating subsidiary, <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b>, Inc</span>., at 'B+'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable from Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Outlook revision is driven by a healthy demand environment, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects to drive improving revenues and margins in 2023. Longer-term trends are positive as <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that United's fleet renewal efforts and growth strategy will mitigate cost pressures and improve the company's competitiveness and margin profile over the intermediate term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s primary concerns focus on United's re-fleeting efforts and heavy period of capital spending that we expect to drive negative FCF at least through 2024. United's capital spending leaves the company with less de-leveraging capacity than some competitors and the possibility of heavy reliance on debt financing should operating cash flows fail to meet expectations. United's sizeable liquidity balance provides downside protection. The company ended the year with total liquidity of more than $18 billion including its undrawn revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Healthy Demand Outlook for 2023: Solid reports around booking trends have provided confidence in an improving operating environment for this year. Several carriers reiterated sustained high levels of demand at recent industry conferences. While United pulled down its first quarter guidance citing costs related to the pull-forward of accruing for pilot wages, fuel costs, and weaker than expected unit revenues, it reiterated its full year targets, citing solid levels of demand in the second quarter and beyond. Demand resilience likely points to an increased priority in consumer spending on experiences over goods coming out of the pandemic, which may hold up despite a weaker macroeconomic environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth is likely to be supported by yoy increases in international and business demand, both of which were depressed during the first half of 2022. This dynamic provides additional upside to United relative to peers as United over-indexes to international and business travel. As such, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United to outpace Delta and American in top-line growth this year. Meanwhile, supply growth is set to remain muted this year due to ongoing pilot shortages and delivery delays from the aircraft manufacturers, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes will support a favorable pricing environment and offset rising operating costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mixed Credit Impact of Fleet Renewal: United is in the midst of an intense period of capital spending related to its United Next plan. Following a December 2022 order for 100 <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 787s, United's order book now includes firm commitments for 700 aircraft to be delivered over the next decade, equivalent to 80% of its total current mainline fleet count. United's fleet renewal efforts result in material up-front capital spending requirements which will limit United's efforts to de-lever its balance sheet. The company originally planned to take delivery of nearly 150 aircraft in 2023, but delays will push roughly 50 planes to into next year. Deliveries in 2024 are likely to be higher assuming OEM delivery rates improve. United expects gross capital spending to total $8.5 billion in 2023. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to remain negative in 2023 and 2024 and for gross debt balances to remain near current levels, assuming a portion of aircraft deliveries are debt funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that United's fleet transformation will have a material positive impact on United's cost structure and on its competitive position in domestic markets. The aircraft on order will be significantly more fuel efficient both in terms of engine technology and in seats per departure. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the fleet renewal as particularly impactful for United's regional operations, where it remains much more heavily reliant on small, inefficient regional jets compared to competitors. Benefits of the updated fleet support <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for United to return to near pre-pandemic levels of profitability by 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cost Pressures Manageable but Risks Remain: The majority of United's union contracts are open for amendment and the company faces cost pressures as wage rates continue to rise. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views these pressures as manageable assuming a supportive demand environment. However, higher costs present downside risks should demand drop off in a recessionary scenario. Pilots, which represent the largest portion of the total salary line, stand to receive substantial pay increases following new deals signed by Delta and <span class="companylink">Spirit Airlines</span> in recent months, both of which included cumulative pay increases of more than 30%. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that United is better positioned than competitors to offset rising wages. The company's fleet renewal program and subsequent increase in average aircraft gauge and fuel efficiency provide material tailwinds in the next several years. United is guiding towards flat yoy non-fuel unit costs for 2023, including the potential impact of pending union contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Substantial but Manageable Debt Burden: At YE 2022, United's debt and lease obligations totaled $37.7 billion, which is down from its peak level during the pandemic but remains roughly 80% higher than pre-pandemic levels on a gross basis. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not expect the company to reduce gross debt levels over the next two years. However, our forecast for EBITDAR generation is improved since our prior review, driving forecasted leverage lower than previous expectations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United's gross adjusted debt/EBITDAR to decline from 6.4x to around 4.5x by YE 2023 and modestly lower thereafter. United's net leverage may drop below 3x by YE 2023, factoring in United's sizeable liquidity balance. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> generally places more consideration on gross leverage figures for airlines as cash balances can decline quickly in adverse scenarios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'B+' rating is two notches above <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> (B-/Positive). The rating differential is driven, in part, by United's total debt burden which remains lower than American's along with a higher liquidity balance. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views United as having lower de-leveraging capacity and greater execution risk relative to American due to the company's capital spending and fleet renewal program. United is three notches below <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> (BB+/Stable), with the difference driven by higher gross leverage at United. Delta also benefits from higher operating margins and pre-pandemic track record of FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--United's capacity grows in the mid-teens in 2023 and in the low to mid-single digits annually thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued travel demand growth in 2023 keeping load factors in the 83%-84% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Flat to modestly increasing unit revenues;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Jet fuel prices averaging around $3.10/gallon in 2023, implying Brent crude prices in the mid $80/barrel range, while crack spreads remain elevated above historical averages;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending in line with the company's public guidance;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--LIBOR at 4.5% in 2023 declining to 3.25% over the forecast period. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes new senior secured debt including EETC debt is issued at roughly 6% through the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Assumptions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> uses a bespoke approach to recovery ratings for issuers rated in the 'B' category as opposed to a generic uplift approach for 'BB' category issuers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery analysis assumes that United would be reorganized as a going concern (GC) in bankruptcy rather than liquidated. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has assumed a 10% administrative claim. The GC EBITDA estimate reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level upon which the agency bases the enterprise valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> uses a GC EBITDA estimate of $5.5 billion and a 5.0x multiple, generating an estimated GC enterprise value (EV) of $27.5 billion prior to an estimated 10% in administrative claims. The GC EBITDA estimate is above United's LTM EBITDA figure of $4.8 billion as 2022 was still heavily impacted by COVID. Our estimate is ~25%-30% below our forecasted 2023 EBITDA envisioning a scenario where structurally weakened demand for air travel and/or higher fuel prices squeeze operating margins to below levels experienced in the pre-pandemic period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This analysis yields a recovery rating of 'RR2' for senior secured creditors, reflecting the possibility that recovery for secured parties could be diluted given the amount of senior debt raised through the downturn. Likewise, United's unsecured recovery rating of 'RR6' reflects the large amount of secured debt in United's capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending towards 4x and EBITDAR fixed-charge towards 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Neutral to positive sustained FCF;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Progress towards United's fleet renewal efforts while maintaining financial flexibility, including maintaining or increasing unencumbered assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 5x or FFO fixed charge coverage sustained below 1.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total liquidity (cash plus revolver availability) declining below $8 billion absent corresponding decrease in outstanding debt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Provides Downside Protection: United ended 2022 with cash, short-term investments and revolver availability totalling $18.2 billion. United's liquidity balance was higher than either of its major peers, and provides a material amount of protection against potential economic pressure. Prior to COVID, United targeted a minimum of $5 billion-$6 billion in total liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company's current liquidity balance, along with improving operating cash flows, to be more than sufficient to cover near-term obligations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United to direct cash towards aircraft deliveries and scheduled debt maturities. As such, unencumbered assets are expected to rise through our forecast period, rebuilding after United utilized much of its unencumbered asset base to raise funds during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Structure: Near-term maturity risk of long-term debt instruments and finance leases is manageable, given an estimated $3.1 billion in 2023. Maturities in 2023 include $1.6 billion payment in EETCs, term loan and finance leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's debt structure primarily consists of aircraft backed EETCs, secured term loans and notes backed by the company's slots/gates/routes collateral, and secured notes and term loan backed by its loyalty program. United has a limited amount of unsecured notes as well as unsecured obligations that arose as part of the government Payroll Support Program.</p>

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-20 December 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has taken the following rating actions on <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span>' enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2019-2:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$208.7 million class A certificates due March 2030 downgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BBB';</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$142.8 million class B certificates due March 2026 affirmed at 'BB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2016-2:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$135.0 million class B certificates due in 2025 downgraded to 'BB' from 'BB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2016-1:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$536.5 million class AA certificates due in 2028 downgraded to 'A' from 'A+';</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$238.6 million class A certificates due in 2028 downgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BBB';</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$158.8 million class B certificates due in 2026 downgraded to 'BB' from 'BB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2014-2:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$500.4 million class A certificates due in 2026 affirmed at 'A'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2014-1:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$433.6 million class A certificates due in 2026 downgraded to 'BBB+' from 'A-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2013-1:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$434.4 million class A certificates due in 2025 downgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Continental 2012-2:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$392.8 million class A certificates due in 2024 downgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrades were driven by an increase in loan-to-value ratios, which was a result of the reclassification of some aircraft from Tier 1 to Tier 2, as well as a continued value stress on widebody aircraft, particularly the B777-300ER. However, these stresses are mitigated by stable values for narrow bodies driven by a recovery in domestic air travel. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects widebody values to stabilize going forward as international travel continues to rebound. The affirmations were driven by Loan-to-value ratios that continue to support the existing ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Affirmation factors within the pools are largely unchanged, as United's fleet renewal is largely in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior expectations. High affirmation factors and liquidity facilities support the notching from United's 'B+' Issuer Default Rating for tranches rated through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom-up approach. The notching is tempered by diminished recovery prospects as a result of the downgrade of aircraft collateralizing the certificates from Tier 1 to Tier 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Tier Updates: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has reclassified several aircraft types included in United's EETC transactions as part of a regular review of our aircraft tier classifications. Aircraft impacted include the B737-900ER, B737-MAX 9, B787-10 and the E175, which were moved to Tier 2 from Tier 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The B737-MAX9 is a new generation aircraft but has only a limited number of operators and aircraft in operations as airlines have tended to take delivery of either the MAX 8 or MAX 10. The B737-900ER is a prior generation aircraft that benefits from commonality with the 737-800 but suffers from a limited user base. While the B787-10 is a new generation technology, it is not as popular as the787-9 and, like the B737-MAX9, has a limited operator base (about 20 airlines). The E175 benefits from reasonable demand with only a relatively small number (about 8%) in storage but suffers from a limited user base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also made a downward adjustment to the base values used in its EETC models for the 777-300ER to account for one appraisal firm whose values were notably above estimates provided by peers. Accounting for this adjustment, 777-300ER values declined by between 13.0% to 16.3% from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >class AA Rating Updates: The affirmation of United's class AA certificates for the 2019-2, 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions at 'A+' is supported by strong LTVs in the low-to-mid 80%, which gives them material headroom within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' stress scenario. The class AA certificates for the 2016-2 and the 2016-1 transaction were downgraded to 'A' from 'A+'. Though the certificates' LTVs pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' category stress scenario, the downgrade reflects weakening LTVs driven by depreciating B777-300ER values, a greater percentage of the collateral pool comprising of Tier 2 aircraft, and high widebody exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >class A Downgrades: United's 2014-1 class A certificates failed to pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' level stress test, driven by exposure to the 737-900ER and E-175, but continued to pass the 'BBB' stress test with adequate headroom. The remaining downgrades to United's other class A certificates were driven by loan-to-value (LTV) ratios that failed to pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'BBB' stress test. According to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria, when LTVs no longer pass the 'BBB' test the transactions are rated via the bottom up approach. The increasing LTV ratios were driven by declining collateral coverage, exposure to 737-900ER, 737 MAX 9, 787-10, E175 aircraft, for which we have lowered the tier classification to tier 2 from tier 1, as well as by weaker 777-300ER values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Bottom-up Approach Ratings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> utilizes a bottom up approach for subordinated tranches. The bottom up approach is also utilized when class AA or A certificates fail to pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'BBB' level stress tests, and the ratings achieved through the bottom up approach act as a ratings floor. Ratings are notched from the airline IDR based on three primary variables: 1) the affirmation factor (0-3 notches) 2) the presence of a liquidity facility, (0-1 notch) and 3) recovery prospects (-1-1 notch).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 2019-2, 2019-1 2018-1, 2016-2, 2016-1 and 2013-1 class A certificates are rated via the bottom-up approach. Tranches rated at 'BBB-' receive a four notch uplift consisting of +2 for a high affirmation factor, +1 for the presence of a liquidity facility and +1 for solid recovery prospects. United's 2016-2 and 2016-1 transactions have limited room for collateral values to weaken further without negatively impacting recovery ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class B certificates are rated either 'BB+' or 'BB'. All of the class B certificates have received +2 notches uplift for a high affirmation factor and a +1 notch uplift for the presence of a liquidity facility. The 2018-1 transaction is the only class B certificate that received a 0 notch uplift for superior recovery prospects. The remainder of United's class B certificates are rated 'BB' and received a -1 notch adjustment for poor recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Affirmation Factor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s views on transaction specific affirmation factors are consistent with prior reviews. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the affirmation factor as 'high' for each transaction but assigns an uplift of '+2' notches rather than the maximum allowance of +3 notches. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers United's 2020 EETC issuance to be a modest detractor for the affirmation factor for each of the transactions that we rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United raised $3 billion in an EETC transaction secured by 352 older vintage aircraft, 99 spare engines, and some spare parts. The aircraft in the pool make up some 45% of United's total mainline fleet. The large number of aircraft included in the transaction along with the operational importance of the spare engines and parts makes it extremely unlikely that United would reject its most recent EETC in a bankruptcy scenario and modestly increases the possibility of rejection for its smaller EETC transactions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The certificates rated 'A+' are in line with other class 'AA' certificates in certain <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> transactions and one notch higher than ratings for several class A certificates issued by other carriers. Stress scenario LTVs for the 2019-2, 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions remain low and continue to support the 'A+' rating. Certificates that are rated 'A' compare well with issuances from American and <span class="companylink">Air Canada</span> that are also rated 'A'. Rating similarities are driven by similar levels of overcollateralization and high-quality pools of collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Certificates rated at 'BBB-', 'BB+' or 'BB' are notched up from United's IDR through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s bottom up approach. The four-notch uplift for transactions rated 'BBB-' is one notch lower than certain similar transactions issued by <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span>, which benefit from higher affirmation factor notching. Certificates rated 'BB+' or 'BB' receive less ratings uplift compared to similar transactions from other issuers due to a combination of a lower affirmation factor or weaker recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include a harsh downside scenario in which <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> declares bankruptcy, chooses to reject the collateral aircraft, and where the aircraft are remarketed in the midst of a severe slump in aircraft values. A <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> bankruptcy is hypothetical and is not <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current expectation as reflected in United's 'B+' IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s models also incorporate a full draw on liquidity facilities and include assumptions for repossession and remarketing costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery analyses for subordinated tranches utilize our 'BB' level stress tests and include a full draw on liquidity facilities and assumptions for repossessions and remarketing costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis incorporates a 6% annual depreciation rate for Tier I aircraft and a 7% annual depreciation rate for Tier II aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--'A' level stresses incorporate a 25% haircut for the 787-9 and 737-800, a 30% haircut for the 787-8, and 35% haircut for the 737-900ER, ERJ 175, and 787-10 aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Top-down approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA certificates and the 2014-2 and 2014-1 class A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. United's 2014-1 class A certificates could be upgraded to 'A-' as the transaction amortizes and collateral coverage improves, allowing the transaction to pass <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'A' category stress test. Positive rating actions are less likely for the remaining tranches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Bottom up approach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's remaining EETC tranches are notched off of United's IDR. Positive rating actions are unlikely in the near term. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently rates United 'B+' with a Negative Rating Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Top-down approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA certificates and the 2014-2 and 2014-1 class A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Therefore, a negative rating action could be driven by an unexpected decline in collateral values. All the class AA certificates remain well overcollateralized, and therefore negative actions based on declining aircraft values are less likely. Collateral coverage for the 2014-2 and 2014-1 class A certificates is less robust. Modest value declines could drive a one-notch downgrade for either transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Bottom-up approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's remaining EETC tranches are notched off of United's IDR. Tranches rated 'BBB-' or 'BB+' and are sensitive to recovery expectations in a stress scenario. Declining asset values could drive weaker recovery prospects, leading to further downgrades. United's 2016-2 and 2016-1 class A certificates have little remaining headroom at the 'BBB-' level due to weakening collateral values. Subordinate tranches are also subject to changes in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of the likelihood of affirmation for the underlying collateral. In addition, tranches rated through the bottom up approach would be subject to downgrade should <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> downgrade United's corporate rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-18 March 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b> Holdings, Inc</span>. and its primary operating subsidiary, <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b>, Inc</span>., at 'B+'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Outlook revision is driven by higher jet fuel prices and increased downside risks presented by inflationary pressures and related economic impacts. These impacts along with United's heavy planned capital spending over the next several years, and remaining uncertainties around traffic recovery related to COVID have increased the risks to United's credit profile. United's total debt balance is up 126% since the beginning of the pandemic, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects deleveraging to be limited in the near term by fuel prices and heavy capital spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's sizeable liquidity balance provides downside protection. At YE 2021, the company maintained roughly $20 billion in total liquidity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also anticipates that United's fleet renewal efforts will drive lower unit costs and improve the company's competitiveness over the intermediate term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fuel Costs are a Material Headwind: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects higher fuel costs to drive lower margins and cash flows in 2022 compared to prior expectations. The magnitude of the impact on credit will depend on how long crude oil prices remain volatile. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the industry to adapt more easily to Brent prices in the $100-$120 range, particularly as pent up demand gives the airlines pricing power. Fuel and airfare have historically maintained a positive correlation and current average fares remain well below peak levels seen during prior periods of high oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >However, the ability to offset higher costs may be limited if crude prices are sustained at or above levels seen in prior peaks, as higher ticket prices and potential macroeconomic effects reduce demand. In a scenario in which Brent crude prices rise and remain materially above $120/barrel, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> would anticipate a potential multi-year lag in airline profit margins returning to pre-pandemic levels, pressuring credit profiles across the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Traffic Improving: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects a continued improvement in passenger traffic in 2022 driven by pent up demand and progress towards COVID reaching an endemic stage. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base expectations are for North American traffic in 2022 to remain 20% below 2019 levels, though that estimate may prove conservative based on current <span class="companylink">TSA</span> passenger counts and reports of strong booking activity for the summer travel season. Business travel remains more of an unknown, though with an increasing number of business returning to the office, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects a healthy uptick through the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Domestic and Near-International Remain Bright Spots: Domestic and near-international leisure travel continue to show the most strength, providing U.S. airlines with a relative advantage to international competitors who are more reliant on international travel. Long-haul international remains the most impacted segment driven by patchwork travel restrictions. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects international travel to improve for the summer season as travel restrictions ease, particularly in the trans-Atlantic market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additional Downside Risks Remain: While the positive inflection in air travel coming out of the Omicron wave is a significant positive, cost inflation and the risk of future virus variants and travel restrictions continue to represent risks to the ratings. Airlines are experiencing pressure on wages, rising airport costs, and maintenance expenses as they catch up on maintenance items that were deferred during the pandemic. Multiple airlines have reported recent increases to starting wages for lower tier employees amid difficulty hiring in a tight labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mixed Credit Impact of Fleet Renewal: United announced an order for 270 new aircraft in mid-2021 as part of its "United Next" plan. In total, United's order book now includes firm commitments for more than 500 aircraft. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes that United's fleet transformation will have a material positive impact on United's cost structure and on its competitive position in domestic markets. The aircraft on order will be significantly more fuel efficient both in terms of engine technology and in seats per departure. Benefits of the updated fleet support <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast for United to return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability by 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >However, United's fleet renewal efforts result in material up-front capital spending requirements which will limit United's efforts to de-lever its balance sheet. The company plans to take delivery of 61 aircraft in 2022 and 121 aircraft 2023, which will represent its peak delivery year. <span class="companylink">Capex</span> is expected to total $5.9 billion in 2022 and $8.5 billion in 2023. As such, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to be materially negative; remaining negative at least through 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Substantial Debt Burden: At YE 2021, United's debt and lease obligations totaled $41.1 billion, roughly double the level from YE 2019. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects United's limited de-leveraging capacity to result in total adjusted debt/EBITDAR remaining at or around 5x through 2025 and potentially higher should oil prices remain elevated. United maintains a public target of less than 2.5x leverage in 2026, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as ambitious. On a net basis, United's increase in debt has been more manageable as United still maintains a sizeable liquidity balance. Adjusted net debt increased by $7.2 billion from YE 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Post 2022 Cost Outlook Better than Peers: United expects to exit 2022 with run rate non-fuel unit costs at or below 2019 levels assuming that it hits its planned capacity expansion targets. United's cost prospects are better than peers, primarily because of its unique opportunity to shift away from 50-seat regional jet (RJ) flying. United is currently over-reliant on cost inefficient small RJs relative to Delta and American, creating a significant opportunity to upgauge over the next several years. At YE 2021, roughly 40% of United's regional fleet consisted of single-class 50-seat RJs compared to less than 20% for American and less than 15% for Delta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'B+' rating remains two notches above American and two notches below Delta. The rating differential is driven, in part, by United's total debt burden which remains lower than American's along with a higher liquidity balance. Prior to the pandemic, United had also maintained a more conservative financial policy relative to American. The two notch differential with Delta is driven by United's higher debt balance and heavier upcoming fleet spending obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Airline traffic continues to rebound throughout the forecast. Domestic traffic is fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, while total airline traffic meets or exceeds 2019 levels by 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Yields are generally strong, reflecting solid demand levels and rising ticket prices to offset higher fuel costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Brent crude prices remaining around $100/barrel for the remainder of 2022 and declining towards $85/barrel through the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notes that jet fuel prices are a primary concern at this time d/t the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Stress cases incorporate materially higher fuel prices through 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex are in line with company forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could lead to an Outlook revision:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increasing evidence of a stabilizing operating environment including a continued rebound in traffic, increasing visibility on the impact of crude oil prices on margins, and on the airline's management of FCF and liquidity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrated ability to manage RASM ahead of total CASM driving EBITDAR margins towards the low teens;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending towards 4x and FFO fixed-charge towards 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Neutral to positive sustained FCF;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--progress towards United's fleet renewal efforts while maintaining financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 5x or FFO fixed charge coverage sustained below 1.x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total liquidity (cash plus revolver availability) declining below $8 billion absent corresponding decrease in outstanding debt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Provides Downside Protection: United ended 2021 with cash, short-term investments and revolver availability totalling $20.2 billion, equivalent to 47% of United's 2019 revenue. United's liquidity balance was higher than either of its major peers, and provides a material amount of protection against further COVID-related disruptions and higher fuel prices. Prior to COVID, United targeted a minimum of $5 billion-$6 billion in total liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While liquidity is high, United's unencumbered assets are below pre-pandemic levels, with the company having utilized many of its major assets for pandemic-related funding. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company's current liquidity balance to be more than sufficient to cover near-term obligations but ability to raise future funding is more limited until the unencumbered asset base is rebuilt. United will likely begin to pay for some aircraft with cash and bring its cash balance down over time, but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that liquidity will remain well above pre-pandemic levels through the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Structure: Near-term maturity risk of long-term debt instruments and finance leases is limited, given an estimated $3.1 billion in 2022. Maturities in 2022 include $400 million of unsecured notes, as well as $2.7 billion payment in EETCs, term loan and finance leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's debt structure primarily consists of aircraft backed EETCs, secured term loans and notes backed by the company's slots/gates/routes collateral, and secured notes and term loan backed by its loyalty program. United has a limited amount of unsecured notes as well as unsecured obligations that arose as part of the government Payroll Support Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Ratings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> uses a bespoke approach to recovery ratings for issuers rated in the 'B' category as opposed to a generic uplift approach for 'BB' category issuers. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery analysis assumes that United would be reorganized as a going concern in bankruptcy rather than liquidated. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has assumed a 10% administrative claim. The going concern (GC) EBITDA estimate reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level upon which the agency bases the enterprise valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> uses a GC EBITDA estimate of $5.5 billion and a 5.5x multiple, generating an estimated GC enterprise value (EV) of $27.3 billion after an estimated 10% in administrative claims. This analysis yields a recovery rating of 'RR2' for senior secured creditors, reflecting the possibility that recovery for secured parties could be diluted given the amount of senior debt raised through the downturn. Likewise, United's unsecured recovery rating of 'RR6' reflects the large amount of secured debt in United's capital structure. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> notes that continued additions of secured debt to the capital structure, absent other debt reduction could lead to a dilution of the secured recovery rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>

                     <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> is a global network airline.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-18 August 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'B-'/'RR6' ratings to two series of special facility revenue bonds to be issued by the City of Houston and Guaranteed by <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b> Holdings, Inc</span>. The city intends to issue two series of airport special facility revenue bonds to finance new multi-terminal baggage handling systems and other upgrades and improvements, with United unconditionally guaranteeing the payment of the bonds. The bonds do not constitute indebtedness to the city of Houston or the airport and neither are liable for any payments. The bonds are secured by a pledge of certain revenues, consisting primarily of net rentals to be paid by United pursuant to a lease between Houston and United.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The series 2021-A bonds will finance the construction of a multi-terminal baggage handling system, tenant and other improvements at International passenger terminal (Terminal E) and related airport facilities for use by United (formerly <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span>) at George H. Bush International Airport/Houston. All of the Terminal E project is owned by the city and has been leased by the city to United. Under the terms of the lease, United has the exclusive use of Terminal E (23 gates) and of other components of the Terminal E project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 2021B-1 bonds will finance the construction of a multi-terminal baggage handling system, tenant and other improvements at International passenger terminal (Terminal C) and related airport facilities for use by United (formerly <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span>) at George H. Bush International Airport/Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings in Line With United's Unsecured Debt: Although the revenue bonds benefit from a security interest in United's lease payments, Fitch views the risk profile of these revenue bonds as closer to United's unsecured issuances. United does not have a master lease at Houston International Airport. Instead, United has multiple leases in place tied to various terminals and facilities. In a bankruptcy scenario, it is possible select leases could take priority and leave other leases to be rejected or consolidated. In certain circumstances, Fitch provides ratings uplift for airport revenue bonds. For instance, American Airlines' JFK bonds are rated above the Issuer Default Rating as the bonds benefit from a single master lease, which Fitch views as having a lower risk of being rejected in a bankruptcy scenario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The risks of potential lease rejections are mitigated by the strategic importance of United's Houston hub. The airport represents United's second largest domestic hub, accounting for 10% of United's system-wide passenger enplanements. The airport has five terminals with 131 gates. United has 100 total gates including its exclusive and preferential gates. Prior to the onset of the coronavirus, United had prioritized growth at its mid-continent hubs like Houston, growing its regional connections to better compete with other network carriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's mid-continent hub strategy had proven successful, and Fitch expects that Houston will remain a key part of that strategy as the airline works to recover from the coronavirus downturn. The bonds are also supported by potential cash flows from replacement lessors should United reject the leases in a bankruptcy. The City of Houston has an obligation to make commercially reasonable efforts to find a replacement lessee for the benefit of the facility bonds should United default on the leases. However, the value to bondholders of a replacement lessee is difficult to ascertain particularly in the current environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Ratings: Fitch uses a bespoke approach to recovery ratings for issuers rated in the 'B' category as opposed to a generic uplift approach for 'BB' category issuers. Fitch's recovery analysis assumes that United would be reorganized as a going concern (GC) in bankruptcy rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim. The GC EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level upon which the agency bases the enterprise valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch uses a GC EBITDA estimate of $5.5 billion and a 5.5x multiple, generating an estimated GC enterprise value (EV) of $27.3 billion after an estimated 10% in administrative claims. This analysis yields a recovery rating of 'RR2' for senior secured creditors, reflecting the possibility that recovery for secured parties could be diluted given the amount of senior debt raised through the downturn. Likewise, United's unsecured recovery rating of 'RR6' reflects the large amount of secured debt in United's capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Delta Variant Risks Domestic Recovery: The rollout of effective COVID vaccines and loosening pandemic-era restrictions across the U.S. has driven a robust rebound in domestic leisure travel, while business and international travel remain weak. The rise of new COVID cases in recent weeks increases the risk that the recovery in traffic may slow or temporarily reverse, though we have not yet seen a material decline in travel. TSA data show that passenger counts are now only around 20% below 2019 levels on a seven-day rolling average basis, about a 20 percentage point improvement compared to when Fitch last reviewed United's ratings in April. Fitch believes that widespread vaccine coverage should prevent a material decline in leisure travel from current levels, though future developments regarding the Delta and other potential variants could change our outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Second Half Outlook: The company saw second quarter revenues reach $5.5 billion, down 52% compared to 2019 levels, an improvement from the first quarter when revenues were down 66% compared to 2019 levels. Fitch expects traffic in the second half to show continued improvement based on strong leisure demand. United has guided to positive adjusted pre-tax income in the second half of 2021. Fitch believes that there is a potential for a delay in United's return to profitability based on rising COVID cases, but 2H21 is nonetheless poised to represent a material improvement from pandemic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'B+' rating remains two notches above American and three notches below Delta. The rating differential is driven, in part, by Fitch's expectation that United's leverage metrics post-pandemic will remain favorable compared to American's, but still too high to support a rating in the 'BB' category. Fitch believes that United managed the crisis effectively especially considering its network has more exposure to international markets that were heavily impacted by the virus. Fitch views the downside risks to United's rating as decreasing, driving the Stable Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Airline traffic (RPMs) remains 45% or more below 2019 levels in 2021, only fully recovering to 2019 levels by 2024. Domestic and leisure travel are likely to rebound more quickly. Fitch believes that leisure travel could be back to 2019 levels on a run rate basis some time in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch's models assume jet fuel prices of approximately $1.60/gallon in 2021, rising to $1.80/gallon in 2023. Actual jet fuel prices have risen above these levels in recent weeks, with spot prices hovering around $1.75. Into-plane prices, including taxes, are modestly higher. Incorporating higher fuel prices into Fitch's models would drive modestly lower margins and greater cash burn in 2021 and 2022, but Fitch believes that the impact by the end of the forecast period would be less minimal as demand normalizes and the airlines are able to raise ticket prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects revenue per available seat mile for the industry to remain below 2019 levels through the forecast period driven by intense competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increasing evidence of a sustainable recovery in air travel;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending towards 4.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FFO fixed-charge towards 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Neutral to positive sustained FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Prolonged downturn in air traffic persisting through 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 5.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FFO fixed charge coverage sustained below 1.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: Risks for United are mitigated by a solid liquidity balance. Fitch believes that United may be able to end the year with $18 billion in liquidity. The company raised roughly $27 billion in 2020 through a combination of debt, equity, and government grants, ending the year with $12.7 billion in available liquidity excluding $7 billion in available loans under the CARES Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Subsequent to the end of 2020, the company completed a $600 million subordinated EETC tranche issuance and issued $9 billion in secured notes and term loans and $1.75 billion revolver secured by all of United's slots gates and routes. A portion of the secured notes and term loan proceeds repaid United's existing $1.4 billion term loan due in 2024, its $1 billion revolver due in 2022 and the $520 Million CARES Act loan due in 2025, with the remainder going to bolster liquidity. United received another $5.8 billion in funds through the second and third round of the government's Payroll Support Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-26 April 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has completed a review of nine public aircraft EETC transactions issued by <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> with 21 rated tranches. Fitch has downgraded six tranches of <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span>' EETCs including the 2019-2 class A, 2018-1 class A, 2016-2 class AA and A, 2016-1 class A, and 2012-2 class A. Fitch has affirmed United's other enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) ratings, including the B tranches for the 2019-2 and 2018-1, 2016-2, and 2016-1 transactions and all tranches of four other transactions. Fitch has also removed United's 2019-1, 2018-1 and 2016-2 certificates from Rating Watch Negative (RWN).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrades are primarily driven by weakened collateral coverage driven by lower secondary market values for the 777-300ERs contained in the affected transactions. While loan-to-value ratios for United's other EETC transactions have also weakened since Fitch's prior review, collateral coverage remains adequate to pass the relevant stress scenarios supporting the current senior tranche ratings. Subordinate tranche ratings have been affirmed at their existing levels despite Fitch's recent downgrade of United from 'BB-' to 'B+'. The affirmations reflect a wider notching band for subordinate EETC tranches for issuers rated in the 'B' category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class AA and A Downgrades</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has downgraded United's 2019-2 class A certificates to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. The downgrade largely reflects continued decline in asset values of certain aircraft, particularly the 777-300ER and the E-175. Values of the relatively new 2019 777-300ER in the transaction have decreased around 13% over the past year according to updated appraisals. In addition to declining asset values, the highest stress rates within Fitch's rating criteria are being applied to most widebody aircraft due to the decline in usage throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United 2018-1 class A certificates have been downgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. The downgrade largely reflects the limited headroom within Fitch's stress scenario due to the decline in asset value for the 777-300ER aircraft. In addition, LTVs for the class A certificates increased, even in the face of a decline in stress rates applied to the six 737-MAX 9 aircraft in the transaction from 30% to 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 2016-2 class AA and class A certificates have been downgraded. The class AA certificates have been downgraded to 'A+' from 'AA-'/RWN and the class A certificates have been downgraded to 'BBB' from 'A-'. United 2016-1 class A certificates have also been downgraded to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'. The downgrades are largely attributed to the steep decline in value of the 777-300ER. Values for the seven 2017 vintage 777s, which make up 68% and 59% of the collateral pool values respectively, decreased around 15% over the past year according to updated appraisals. As such, the class AA certificates no longer pass Fitch's 'AA' level stress tests and the 2016-2 class A certificates no longer pass Fitch's 'A' level stress tests. The downgrade of the 2016-2 class AA certificates is in-line with the other United class AA tranches that have all since been downgraded into the 'A' rating category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Continental 2012-2 class A certificates have been downgraded. The transaction fails to pass Fitch's 'A' level stress scenario with LTVs increasing 3.3% since the prior review. The tranche has some rating upside as the model shows that the transaction could again pass the 'A' level stress scenario, with limited headroom, 2 years out as the tranche continues to amortize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has removed the Rating Watch Negative from United's 2016-2 class AA certificates. At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Fitch put all 'AA' category EETC ratings on Rating Watch Negative due to the uncertainty surrounding the industry. Since the 2016-2 class AA certificates have been downgraded below the 'AA' rating category the Rating Watch has been removed. Fitch has also removed the negative rating watch from United's 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions. The rating watches were related to the grounding of the 737 MAX's contained in those portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class AA and A Affirmations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has affirmed the remainder of United's class AA and class A EETC transactions. The remainder of the class AA certificate ratings are affirmed at 'A+' and include 2019-2, 2019-1, 2018-1, and 2016-1. All of the transactions remain well overcollateralized and retain a large amount of headroom within Fitch's 'A' category stress test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has affirmed the remainder of United's class A certificates. The 2014-2 class A certificates have been affirmed at 'A', the 2014-1 class A certificates have been affirmed at 'A-', the 2018-1 and 2016-1 class A certificates have been affirmed at 'BBB+', and the 2019-1 and 2013-1 class A certificates have been affirmed at 'BBB'.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Subordinated Tranche Ratings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has affirmed all of United's class B certificates. Fitch notches subordinated tranche EETC ratings from the airline IDR based on three primary variables: 1) the affirmation factor (0-3 notches) 2) the presence of a liquidity facility, (0-1 notch) and 3) recovery prospects (0-1 notch).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class B certificates are rated either 'BB+' or 'BBB-'. All of the class B certificates have received +2 notches uplift for a high affirmation factor and a +1 notch uplift for the presence of a liquidity facility. Fitch's criteria allows for 0-2 notches of affirmation factor uplift for carriers rated in the 'BB' category and 0-3 notches for carriers in the 'B' category. Fitch previously applied only +1 notch of affirmation factor uplift to United's sub-tranches, but expanded the notching uplift to +2 following United's downgrade to 'B+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 2014-2 transaction is the only class B certificate that received a +1 notch uplift for superior recovery prospects due to the relatively low LTV and solid collateral coverage for that tranche.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Affirmation Factor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch considers the affirmation factor for each of the collateral pools in each of these EETCs to be 'high'. However, notching is limited to +2 as opposed to the maximum of +3. Fitch considers United's 2020 EETC issuance to be a modest detractor for the AF for each of the transactions that we rate. United raised $3 billion in an EETC transaction secured by 352 older vintage aircraft, 99 spare engines, and some spare parts. The aircraft in the pool make up some 45% of United's total mainline fleet. The large number of aircraft included in the transaction along with the operational importance of the spare engines and parts makes it extremely unlikely that United would reject its most recent EETC in a bankruptcy scenario, and modestly increasing the possibility of rejection for its smaller EETC transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include a harsh downside scenario in which United declares bankruptcy, chooses to reject the collateral aircraft, and where the aircraft are remarketed in the midst of a severe slump in aircraft values. A <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> bankruptcy is hypothetical, and is not Fitch's current expectation as reflected in United's 'B+' IDR. Fitch's models also incorporate a full draw on liquidity facilities and include assumptions for repossession and remarketing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch's recovery analyses for subordinated tranches utilize Fitch's 'BB' level stress tests and include a full draw on liquidity facilities and assumptions for repossessions and remarketing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EETC models also include standard depreciation rates for aircraft values as outlined in Fitch's criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Value Stresses:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >777-300ER: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX 9: AA level - 45%, A level - 25%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737-800: AA level - 45%, A level - 25%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737-900ER: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >787-10: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >787-9: AA level - 45%, A level - 25%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >787-8: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >E-175: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive rating actions are unlikely in the near-term due to pressure on the airline industry related to the coronvairus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA and A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Therefore, a negative rating action could be driven by an unexpected decline in collateral values. All the class AA certificates remain well overcollateralized to support 'A+' ratings. UAL 2014-1 class A certificates rated at 'A-' have limited headroom at their current ratings and negative rating actions may be driven by modest declines in aircraft values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Subordinated tranche ratings are based off of United's underlying airline IDR of 'B+' and are sensitive to recovery expectations in a stress scenario. Subordinate tranches are also subject to changes in Fitch's view of the likelihood of affirmation for the underlying collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-29 March 2021: LEAD PARAGRAPH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span>' Issuer Default Rating to 'B+' from 'BB-' and revised the Outlook to Stable. The pace of air traffic recovery combined with pressure on the balance sheet will make it difficult for United to achieve credit metrics that support the 'BB-' rating before 2023, prompting the one-notch downgrade to 'B+'. United's balance sheet debt increased by $12.2 billion in 2020, equivalent to approximately 1.5 turns of 2019 EBITDAR. Gross debt may increase further assuming United draws its availability under the government Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act loan. Fitch believes that United's gross leverage could remain near 5x or higher by the end of 2023 which is high for a 'BB' category rating. United will have limited remaining unencumbered assets, leaving the company with reduced financial flexibility compared to prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >However, <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> managed the crisis effectively despite its network having more exposure to international markets that were heavily impacted by the virus. Fitch views the downside risks to United's rating as decreasing, driving the Stable Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Industry Update:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Airline traffic has recovered more slowly than Fitch's prior expectations through 1Q21. Global outbreaks of COVID caused a reimposition of travel restrictions and for leisure travel to be discouraged. U.S. traffic and bookings have improved materially in recent weeks around spring break, leading to rising passenger counts in March, but overall performance in 1Q21 remains weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's prior forecasts had anticipated that at this point in the crisis, traffic would be down by approximately 40%-45% compared to 2019 levels. While passenger counts are improving to 30%- 40% on peak travel days, rolling seven-day averages remain 50% or more below 2019 levels. Traffic as measured by RPMs will be worse than passenger counts due to the lack of long-haul travel. 2Q21 and beyond may be more promising, with several carriers reporting stronger bookings. For example, American reported that bookings in recent weeks have been only 20% below 2019 levels, the largest improvement since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Traffic Rebound Expected but Uncertainties Remain: Fitch anticipates a fairly robust rebound, particular in leisure and VFR traffic, once traveler confidence improves driven by a great deal of pent up demand. Recent surveys conducted by IATA and <span class="companylink">Oliver Wyman</span> indicate that a majority of respondents expect to travel as much or more once the pandemic is over compared to pre-pandemic level, with most respondents also indicating a desire to prioritize travel in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch also believes that the economic impacts of the pandemic have been disproportionately weighted toward lower income households. Higher earners, who have a higher propensity to travel, have been less impacted, and may help to drive the rebound in travel later this year. Although the successful development of COVID vaccines has driven an improvement to Fitch's sector outlook, serious uncertainties remain. There is a possibility that new variants of the coronavirus could prolong the epidemic and delay a recovery in travel. Travel restrictions will also likely limit long-haul travel recovery, and the pandemic's impact on lucrative business travel remains uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Cash Burn: United recently announced that it expects core cash flow to turn positive in March based on the recent uptick in bookings, and to remain positive assuming the booking trajectory continues. United's definition of core cash flow excludes debt principal payments, capex and certain one-time items and so does not reflect all cash inflows and outflows. Nonetheless, the turn to positive represents a meaningful improvement after burning cash for nearly a full year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Material Cost Cuts: Permanent changes to the airline's cost structure will be key to returning to pre-pandemic levels of profitability. United announced on its first quarter earnings call that it will permanently reduce annual operating costs by $2 billion and expects to exceed 2019 EBITDA margins by 2023. Fitch's forecast is more conservative. The agency does not anticipate a return to 2019 level margins until 2024 driven by a slow rebound in demand. Expense reduction comes through a permanently lower level of management head count, reduced number of regional partners and renegotiated agreements with suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital spending: United expects gross capex to total $4.4 billion in 2021 and it has capital commitments for nearly $3 billion in both 2022 and 2023. The company has stated that it will not take delivery of new aircraft unless they are fully financed, so capital spending is not expected to be a major net drain on cash. However, the company's ability to reduce its gross debt balance will be limited over the next two years. United's fleet is older than its network peers with an average age of 16 years vs. 13.5 for Delta and 10.8 for American, resulting in relatively high spending requirements at United.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Ratings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch uses a bespoke approach to recovery ratings for issuers rated in the 'B' category as opposed to a generic uplift approach for 'BB' category issuers. Fitch's recovery analysis assumes that United would be reorganized as a going concern in bankruptcy rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim. The going concern (GC) EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level upon which the agency bases the enterprise valuation. Fitch uses a GC EBITDA estimate of $5.5 billion and a 5.5x multiple, generating an estimated GC enterprise value (EV) of $27.3 billion after an estimated 10% in administrative claims. This analysis yields a recovery rating of 'RR2' for senior secured creditors, reflecting the possibility that recovery for secured parties could be diluted given the amount of senior debt raised through the downturn. Likewise, United's unsecured recovery rating of 'RR6' reflects the large amount of secured debt in United's capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) Ratings: Subordinated tranche ratings of United's EETC transactions may be impacted by the downgrade of United's IDR. Fitch will be reviewing United's EETC ratings in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'B+' rating remains two notches above American and three notches below Delta. The rating differential is driven, in part, by Fitch's expectation that United's leverage metrics post-pandemic will remain favorable compared to American's, but still too high to support a rating in the 'BB' category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Airline traffic (RPMs) remains 45% or more below 2019 levels in 2021, only fully recovering to 2019 levels by 2024. Domestic and leisure travel are likely to rebound more quickly. Fitch believes that leisure travel could be back to 2019 levels on a run rate basis some time in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch's models assume jet fuel prices of approximately $1.60/gallon in 2021, rising to $1.80/gallon in 2023. Actual jet fuel prices have risen above these levels in recent weeks, with spot prices hovering around $1.75. Into-plane prices, including taxes, are modestly higher. Incorporating higher fuel prices into Fitch's models would drive modestly lower margins and greater cash burn in 2021 and 2022, but Fitch believes that the impact by the end of the forecast period would be less minimal as demand normalizes and the airlines are able to raise ticket prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM) for the industry to remain below 2019 levels through the forecast period driven by intense competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increasing evidence of a sustainable recovery in air travel;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending towards 4x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FFO fixed-charge towards 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Neutral to positive sustained FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Prolonged downturn in air traffic persisting through 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FFO fixed charge coverage sustained below 1.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Liquidity: Risks for United are mitigated by a solid liquidity balance. Fitch believes that, given a rebound in traffic in 2H21, United may be able to end the year with $17 billion in liquidity. The company raised roughly $27 billion in 2020 through a combination of debt, equity, and government grants, ending the year with $12.7 billion in available liquidity excluding $7 billion in available loans under the CARES Act. Fitch's models assume that United will draw on its CARES Act loan. Liquidity was bolstered in 1Q21 through United's $600 million subordinated EETC tranche issuance, and another $2.6 billion in funds received through the second round of the government's Payroll Support Program (PSP2). United is likely to receive a similar amount in the third round of payroll support that was included in President Biden's coronavirus relief package.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-30 October 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded multiple tranches of <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span>' enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETC). The rating actions are driven by the combined effects of increased value stress assumptions used in Fitch's models, which reflect the ongoing pressure on the airline industry, and updated appraisal values that show declining levels of overcollateralization for certain transactions. Select senior tranche ratings have been affirmed, reflecting strong levels of overcollateralization and attractive underlying collateral that continue to support the existing ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Class AA and A Ratings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has downgraded five series of <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b></span> class AA certificates as detailed below. Four of five transactions were downgraded to 'A+' from 'AA' as a combination of lower asset values and increased value stress assumptions have caused the transactions to no longer pass Fitch's 'AA' category stress test. The 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions remain on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) reflecting the inclusion of 737 MAXs in the collateral pools, and continued uncertainty around the MAX's return to service. Within the 'A' rating category, United's class AA certificates remain well positioned at 'A+' reflecting sufficient levels of overcollateralization to pass Fitch's 'A'-level stress tests with a material amount of headroom. Fitch has downgraded United's 2016-2 class AA certificates by one notch to 'AA-'. The 2016-2 transaction has a modestly lower stress scenario LTV compared to other 'AA' certificates such that the transaction continues to pass Fitch's 'AA' category stress test, but with limited headroom. Further value declines could drive the 2016-2 rating down by one notch. As such, the transaction remains on RWN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has downgraded United's 2019-1, 2018-1, 2016-1 and 2013-1 class A certificates into the 'BBB' category. The downgrades reflect lower levels of collateral coverage, primarily for transactions that have heavy exposure to widebodies. Fitch has downgraded the 2014-1 and 2012-2 class A certificates to 'A-' from 'A'. These transactions maintain modestly lower LTVs compared to class A certificates that were downgraded into the 'BBB' category, but headroom at the current rating level is more limited and the ratings may be downgraded if asset value depreciation outpaces assumptions used in Fitch's models. Fitch has also affirmed the class A certificates for United's 2019-2, 2016-2 and 2014-2 transactions. The 'A-' ratings for the 2019-2 and 2016-2 transactions reflect continued sufficient levels of overcollateralization to pass Fitch's 'A'-category stress test with limited headroom. The 'A' rating for 2014-2 is driven by the make-up of the collateral pool, which is more heavily weighted towards attractive 787-9s, such that the transaction comfortably passes Fitch's 'A'-category test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Value Stress Updates:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has updated its value stress assumptions across all transactions to reflect the current state of the aviation industry. The highest stress rates are being applied to widebody aircraft, including the 777-300ER and 787-10. The agency has not applied any value stresses that are outside of the ranges specified in Fitch's rating criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes that the agency's current stress rates remain appropriate despite the unprecedented levels of disruption to the industry. This is supported by a comparison of the most recent values provided by the agency's appraisals. In general, declines in base values over the past year have been higher than Fitch would expect in a typical year, but they have not been catastrophic. For instance, newer vintage 737-800 base values declined by approximately 8%, which is only modestly above Fitch's standard depreciation assumption. In general, widebody values fared worse than narrowbodies, with older vintage 777s and A330s experiencing some of the greatest declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Note that Fitch is also using a 6% depreciation rate for all tier 1 aircraft in our models, up from 5% as of the last review. The increased depreciation reflects general concerns around aircraft values due to coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >LTV Summary:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The value stresses listed below produce the following maximum LTVs for transactions rated through Fitch's top-down approach:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2019-2 class AA: Base Case - 44%, 'A' stress Case - 73%;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Subordinated tranche ratings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has also downgraded all of United's class B certificates by one notch. The downgrades reflect a reassessment of the likelihood of affirmation for these transactions. Fitch notches subordinated tranche EETC ratings from the airline Issuer Default Rating (IDR) based on three primary variables: 1) the affirmation factor (0-2 notches) 2) the presence of a liquidity facility (0-1 notch) and 3) recovery prospects (0-1 notch). The certificates are rated either 'BB+' or 'BBB-', representing either a +2 or +3 notch uplift from United's 'BB-' IDR. Fitch considers all of United's EETCs to have a moderate-to-high affirmation factor as discussed further below. Affirmation contributes one notch of ratings uplift. Each transaction receives one notch of uplift for the benefit of an 18-month liquidity facility. The transactions rated at 'BBB-' receive one further notch of uplift representing superior recovery prospects in a stress scenario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Affirmation Factor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch considers United's recent EETC issuance to be a detractor for the AF for each of the transactions that the agency rates. United recently raised $3 billion in an EETC transaction secured by 352 older vintage aircraft, 99 spare engines and some spare parts. The aircraft in this pool make up some 45% of United's total mainline fleet. The large number of aircraft included in the transaction along with the operational importance of the spare engines and parts makes it extremely unlikely that United would reject its most recent EETC in a bankruptcy scenario, in turn, making it somewhat more likely that some pools of newer aircraft could be rejected if United needed to downsize. United's long-term fleet plan is still more likely to revolve around its youngest/most efficient aircraft, which are represented in the collateral pools in these EETC transactions. Fitch does not believe that United would reject pools of newer planes in favor of operating older, less efficient aircraft because that would put the company at a longer-term cost disadvantage. Rather, downsizing would more likely occur at the expense of leased aircraft. However, Fitch believes that the benefit from the affirmation factor no longer supports a two-notch uplift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Going Concern:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >One of the considerations in Fitch's assessment of the affirmation factor is the likelihood that the underlying airline would continue as a going concern if it were to undergo a period of financial distress. In this case, we believe that there is a strong likelihood that United would continue as a going concern given its position as one of the three major U.S. network carriers and as one of the largest airlines in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's Overall Fleet Strategy:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's order book through the early 2020s largely consists of 737 MAXs on the narrowbody side, a handful of 787s for the widebody fleet, and ERJ 175s to bolster the regional fleet. The pools of aircraft represented by the UAL EETCs are all considered strategically important and are likely to remain important over the intermediate term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch considers the overall affirmation factor for each of these transactions to be high, affirmation for the 2019-1, 2018-1, 2016-2 and 2016-1 transactions is marginally better when compared the older UAL transactions due to a greater degree of diversification and the newness of the aircraft. The 2018-1, 2016-2 and 2016-1 transactions each contain four aircraft types, which is high compared to many EETCs that Fitch rates. They also include a concentration of 777-300ERs, which represent the flagships of UAL's widebody fleet and were key to UAL's decision to retire its relatively inefficient 747 fleet. The last of UAL's 747s were retired in 2017, leaving the 777-300ER as the airline's premier aircraft for key long-haul routes. Given its current order book, United will only operate 18 777-300ERs, 17 of which are included in these three EETC transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >UAL 2014-1 and 2014-2 are also fairly diversified, featuring four and three different aircraft types, respectively. While they do not benefit from the affirmation considerations that come along with the 777s in the newer transactions, they do benefit from the presence of 787s, which are new technology, highly fuel-efficient planes that will help to replace UAL's aging 767s. Aside from replacing older widebodies, the 787s serve as a key addition to the fleet, allowing UAL to serve city pairs that were not previously accessible with older planes. In addition, the 787 features significantly lower costs, including 20% lower fuel consumption, and 30% lower airframe maintenance costs, compared to similarly sized aircraft. Affirmation for 2014-1 and 2014-2 also benefits from the inclusion ERJ-175s. Although Fitch views the E175 as a relatively weak tier one aircraft, they are key to UAL's strategy to increase regional flying and improve connectivity at its mid-continent hubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The affirmation factor for the 2013-1 and 2012-2 transactions is considered marginally weaker compared to the newer UAL deals, but is still considered strong overall. UAL 2013-1 and 2012-2 are less diversified than the other deals, featuring only two aircraft types. The aircraft in these transactions also no longer represent United's newest deliveries, having average ages nearing or exceeding six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nevertheless, the affirmation factor for all three deals is supported by a high concentration of 737-900ERs. The 737-900ER currently comprises roughly 17% of United's mainline fleet and acts as a direct replacement for older 757s making them strategically important for the company's fleet plan. The range of the -900ER makes it ideal an ideal plane for longer distance domestic routes, while incorporating significantly lower trip costs than the less fuel efficient 757-200. As of YE 2019 United still operated 74 757s between the -200 and -300 model, which are much more likely to be parked in a bankruptcy scenario compared to the -900ERs in these portfolios. UAL 2013-1 and 2012-2 also include 787-8s, the smallest variant of the 787 family. These aircraft serve as solid replacements for 767-300ERs. United still operates more than 38 767-300ERs that have an average age of 20+ years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The certificates rated 'A+' are one notch higher than ratings for several class A certificates issued by other carriers. Stress scenario LTVs for the 2019-2, 2019-1, 2018-1 and 2016-1 transactions remain low and continue to support the 'A+' rating. Class A certificates that are rated 'A' compare well with issuances from American, <span class="companylink">Air Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">British Airways</span> that are also rated 'A'. Rating similarities are driven by similar levels of overcollateralization and high-quality pools of collateral. Class A certificates rated at 'A-' are a notch lower than several other comparable issuances primarily due to weaker levels of overcollateralization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 'BBB' ratings on the class B certificates are derived through a four-notch uplift from United's IDR. The four-notch uplift reflects a high affirmation factor, benefit of a liquidity facility and no benefit for recovery expectations. The class B certificates rated 'BBB-' receive +2 notches for a high affirmation factor and one notch for the benefit of a liquidity facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Value Stresses:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >777-300ER: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX 9: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737-800: AA level - 45%, A level - 25%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737-900ER: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >787-10: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >787-9: AA level - 45%, A level - 25%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >787-8: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >E-175: AA level - 50%, A level - 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive rating actions are not anticipated in the near-term. Asset values and the credit quality of the underlying airline, which are the key rating drivers for EETCs, remain under pressure from the coronavirus, making positive rating actions unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's class AA and A certificates are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Therefore, a negative rating action could be driven by an unexpected decline in collateral values. The 2016-2 class AA certificates retain little headroom at the current rating level and may be downgraded should asset values decline further. Other class AA certificates remain well overcollateralized to support 'A+' ratings. Class A certificates rated at 'A-' have limited headroom at their current ratings and negative rating actions may be driven by modest declines in aircraft values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Subordinated tranche ratings are based off of the underlying airline IDR. However, Fitch's criteria allow for wider notching for the affirmation factor when the issuer's IDR goes to 'B+' from 'BB'. If United were downgraded to 'B+', some class B certificates could be affirmed at their existing levels. Subordinate tranches are also sensitive to recovery expectations in a stress scenario. Subordinate tranches are also subject to changes in Fitch's view of the likelihood of affirmation for the underlying collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Criteria Variation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's EETC criteria does not contemplate a scenario where the collateral aircraft are grounded by governmental authorities and are unable to fly. Continued inclusion of the MAXs in United's 2019-1 and 2018-1 transactions constitute variations from Fitch's criteria.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-25 June 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BBB-(EXP)' ratings with a Stable Outlook to the new proposed issuance of $6.8 billion in financing to be issued by Mileage Plus Intellectual Property Assets, Ltd. (MIPA) and MileagePlus Holdings, LLC (MPH). The affirmation reflects the increased issuance from $5.0 billion to $6.8 billion. MIPA is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands for the purpose of this transaction, while MPH is a Delaware limited liability company. Both entities are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b> Holdings, Inc</span>. (UAL) and <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b>, Inc</span>. (United). The proceeds of the issuance will be lent to United through an intercompany loan for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" > The term loan and notes, referred to as the financing of debt facilities, are pari passu and supported by the same collateral and security package; the issuers and debt facilities are rated 'BBB-(EXP)' with a Stable Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >MPH/MIPA Financing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes ; Long Term Rating; Affirmed; BBB-(EXP); RO:Sta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----Senior Secured Floating Rate Term Loan ; Long Term Rating; Affirmed; BBB-(EXP); RO:Sta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Transaction Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The transaction is backed by payments to be made to MIPA under a license agreement signed with MPH and United for the use of the Mileage Plus Intellectual Property (IP) assets. MIPA, as owner and licensor of the IP, licenses the IP to MPH which then sub licenses the IP to United. Through the license agreements, MIPA grants a worldwide license to United and its subsidiaries to use the IP to operate the loyalty program, Mileage Plus. The licensees then pay a monthly license fee equivalent to all the revenues generated by the Mileage Plus program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The senior secured financing will be guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by United, its parent and the certain operating subsidiaries under MPH, as well as certain subsidiaries of the parent. The issuers grant additional security to the lenders, including a first priority perfected security interest in the cash flow from the Mileage Plus program, a pledge of all rights under contracts/agreements related to the Mileage Plus program, a pledge of the cash collection accounts and a pledge over the equity interests in the operating subsidiaries of MPH.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's rating reflects timely payment of interest and timely payment of scheduled principal by the legal final maturity date expected June 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >KEY RATING DRIVERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Quality of United: Cash flow backing the transaction will primarily come from payment obligations from UAL and United under the licensing agreement related to intellectual properties owned by the IP SPV/MIPA. Therefore, the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of United acts as the starting point for the analysis. United is rated at 'BB-' with a Negative Outlook. For more information, please reference the Impact on Corporate IDR section below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Performance Risk and GCA Score: Timely payment on the notes/loan depends on the ongoing performance of the licensee, United. United's going concern assessment (GCA) score of '2' acts as a cap for the transaction rating. The GCA score provides an indication of the likelihood that United continues to operate in the event of default and Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The GCA score of '2' could allow for up to a four-notch differential between United's IDR and the issuance's default rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strategic Nature of Assets (Likelihood of Affirmation of License Agreement): The affirmation factor, which measures the likelihood that United would view this obligation as strategic and would affirm or continue to make the licensing fee in the event of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is considered high by Fitch. The strategic importance of the IP assets to United's operations coupled with the structural incentives supports this assessment. The assessment of high allows the transaction to obtain a three-notch uplift from United's current IDR of 'BB-'/Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $6.8 billion issuance is expected to be less than 20% of United's total liabilities, and this level is considered sufficient to differentiate the transaction rating from the IDR of United. Furthermore, in its debt service coverage ratio calculations, Fitch considers a 96% rebound from 2019 levels for its base case by YE 2023. The minimum coverage levels are expected to be approximately 2x with an average of 3.25x during the amortization period. Overall, Fitch estimates cash flow to be sufficient to meet debt service obligations. These concepts contribute to Fitch's overall view on the affirmation factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset Isolation and Legal Structure: Fitch assesses the legal and structural protections incorporated into the transaction. In addition to having the IP assets legally conveyed, bondholders have a first-perfected security interest in rights under contractual obligations due from United, its cobrand partner and other third parties. The legal structure incentivizes United to continue to make payments on the license as creditors will benefit from other structural features, including other guarantees, potential liquidated damages claims and a three-month liquidity reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not anticipate developments with a high likelihood of triggering an upgrade. If United's IDR is upgraded, Fitch will consider whether the same uplift could be maintained or if it should be further tempered in accordance with criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of United, which acts as licensee under the IP license agreement. Any change in IDR can lead to a change on the rating or the transaction. A reassessment of the GCA score or the affirmation factor from high to medium could also lead to a change in the ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >According to the analytical framework in the criteria, the transaction rating could withstand a one-notch downgrade of United's current IDR of 'BB-'/Negative. However, a downgrade of more than one notch on United's IDR would lead to a downgrade of the debt facilities. A change in Fitch's assessment of the affirmation factor and the GCA score could also result in rating actions. Nonetheless, in a case where the company's IDR changes, Fitch will review the affirmation factor and reassess the notching uplift potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Impact on Corporate IDR:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Incremental Debt to Materially Shore Up Liquidity: Including the proposed issuance, Fitch expects United to end the second quarter with around $12 billion in cash. The company will retain access to roughly $4.5 billion in loans under the CARES act. The additional capital raise materially reduces liquidity risk well into 2021, even if traffic remains subdued, but adds a significant amount of debt to the balance sheet, which will lead to elevated leverage for the next few years. Fitch believes the additional risk is partially offset by United's ability to de-lever. Assuming passenger traffic trends toward 2019 levels by 2023, United should be able to pay down a material amount of debt over that time period. Fitch's forecast shows the company generating significant FCF starting in 2021 based on lower operating costs and sharply lower capex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's updated forecast shows leverage around 6x at YE 2021, which is high for the rating, but leverage is expected to track lower thereafter. Fitch's updated forecast indicates leverage will remain above the negative sensitivity through 2021 and potentially 2022, but other metrics, like fixed-charge coverage and FCF, return to within sensitivities in a shorter timeframe. Fitch's forecasts assume traffic continues to recover through 2021, though remaining well below 2019 levels. Should the expectations for air traffic recovery to take longer than currently expected, or should cash burn remain higher than Fitch forecasts into 2021, the corporate ratings could be downgraded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity(ies), either due to their nature or to the way in which they are being managed by the entity(ies).

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Structured Finance transactions have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of seven notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of seven notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAAsf' to 'Dsf'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-19 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b> Holdings, Inc</span>. (UAL) and its airline operating subsidiary, <span class="companylink"><b>United Airlines</b>, Inc</span>. at 'BB' and revised its Rating Outlook to Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Outlook is based on the sharp drop in demand occurring in the market due to efforts to contain the coronavirus. U.S. airlines are reporting steep and broad-based declines in passenger numbers since the virus began to appear widely outside of China. Fitch's current forecast for United anticipates that the company will be able to return to credit metrics that support the 'BB' rating in 2021. However, Fitch's forecasts depend on air traffic returning toward normal levels over the course of 2020. The Negative Outlook reflects the rapidly evolving impact of the coronavirus, the potential for traffic to be affected for significantly longer than in prior crises, and United's large international exposure, which has been hit particularly hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings affirmation at the 'BB' level reflects generally positive trends at United including the company's solid operational and financial performance relative to peers over the past two years. The company also has sufficient liquidity on-hand, options to raise cash in the future, and manageable near-term maturities that cushion it from financial distress.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >----senior unsecured; Long Term Rating; Affirmed; BB</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Assumptions: Fitch's main coronavirus scenario includes a sharp downturn, followed by a recovery in the second half in line with prior downturns. This scenario would hurt United's credit metrics, but improvement in the second half and 2021 would lead United's credit metrics to be supportive of the current rating by YE 2021 or early 2022. Both liquidity and debt levels would leave United in an initially weaker state after the initial sharp downturn, exposing it to additional exogenous shocks if they should arise. Fitch also evaluated a scenario with a longer coronavirus impact, which is a significant risk, and this scenario would push United outside of Fitch's negative sensitivities through 2021, which would lead to a downgrade. This risk is incorporated in the Negative Outlook. Fitch's coronavirus scenario analyzed monthly cash burn assuming a revenue drop of at least 75% over the next few months. This scenario will be revised further as more data becomes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Mitigating Actions: United has obtained a $2 billion term loan secured by aircraft aimed at shoring up liquidity, leaving it with more than $8 billion in liquidity going into this event. The company has also recently reported an unencumbered asset balance that it estimates at $20 billion, inclusive of its Mileage Plus plan, that can be leveraged to raise cash if needed. United announced a hiring freeze and is pursuing voluntary unpaid leave for its employees. The company cut its capex forecast for 2020 to $4.5 billion, down from roughly $7 billion from its prior plans. Fitch anticipates that these measures should provide sufficient liquidity to weather a sharp downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt maturities for the year are manageable. Total principal payments on debt and finance leases total roughly $1.5 billion for 2020, which should be addressable with cash on hand along with other available liquidity options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The price of jet fuel is also a key consideration. The recent drop in crude prices plus reductions in flying could cut United's fuel bill by 40% or more in 2020. United spent $8.95 billion in fuel in 2019, or 23% of its total operating costs. Fitch's stress case incorporates jet fuel of around $1.50/gallon for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International Exposure: United is the most international-focused US network carrier, with only 62.3% of its 2019 revenue coming from domestic service. International travel has been particularly hard hit in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, presenting a larger headwind for United than for some other carriers. 17.1% of United's 2019 passenger revenue was derived from trans-Atlantic travel and 11.8% from the Pacific region, both of which are being severely restricted in the current environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Solid Credit Metrics Prior to Outbreak: Fitch calculates United's total adjusted debt/EBITDAR at 3x as of YE 2019 which we consider to be supportive for the rating. FFO fixed-charge coverage is also solid for the rating at over 4x. United maintains stronger metrics than Spirit, a competitor that is also rated in the 'BB' category. United's leverage and profitability metrics remain modestly weaker than its network competitor Delta, which Fitch rates at 'BBB-'. United's weaker leverage metrics are partially offset by its smaller pension liabilities compared to Delta, which Fitch does not include in its leverage calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF to Improve: Coronavirus disruption and capital spending will likely push FCF sharply negative for 2020. Fitch expects a recovery in demand and moderating capital spending in future years to drive positive FCF that will allow the company to pay down incremental debt raised to shore up liquidity during this period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's prior forecasts anticipated that United would generate significantly positive FCF over the multi-year forecast period after 2020 which would largely have been directed back to shareholders. United spent $1.65 billion on repurchases in 2019 and $1.2 billion in 2018. United suspended its share repurchase program as concerns about the virus increased, representing a meaningful cash preservation lever. Fitch views share repurchase activity as unlikely over the next two years at least as the company will more likely focus on its balance sheet after demand recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >United's 'BB' rating is in between the ratings of its two major network rivals, <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> and American Airlines. The ratings distinction between the three airlines is reflective of the financial strategies adopted by each airline. For instance, following its merger with <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span>, Delta aggressively de-leveraged its balance sheet and now maintains a leverage ratio of less than 2x, compared with 3x for United. American Airlines on the other hand, has adopted a more aggressive financial policy, borrowing heavily to finance new aircraft deliveries while simultaneously sending material amounts of cash to shareholders via share repurchases. As such, American's debt levels have risen since it exited bankruptcy and it now maintains an adjusted leverage metric of just over 5x. United's ratings are in line with <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span>. <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> benefits from lower leverage metrics than United, offset by its smaller size and geographic reach. Fitch also rates <span class="companylink">Spirit Airlines</span> 'BB'. Spirit's leverage metrics are weaker than United's but its credit profile is supported by its low cost structure and high operating margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A sharp drop in near-term demand leading to revenues down 75% or more over the next several months;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fuel costs at $1.50/gallon through 2020;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A gradual return to normal bookings in the back half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >---EBITDAR margins deteriorating into the low double-digit range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Persistently negative or negligible FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR trending towards 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FFO fixed-charge sustained at or above 4x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF as a percentage of revenue sustained in the mid-single digits;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued improvements in United's operational performance;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Evidence of improving unit revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sufficient Liquidity: As of YE 2019, United maintained approximately $6.9 billion in total liquidity including full availability under its $2.0 billion revolver. Liquidity as a percentage of LTM revenue was 16.1%, which along with other efforts to raise capital should allow the company to manage through the coronavirus situation in the near term. The company also maintains a sizable and growing base of unencumbered assets that can be tapped to raise funds if needed in the case of a downturn.</p>

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>
