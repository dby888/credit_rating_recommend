<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-14 July 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b>, Inc.</span>'s proposed $500 million of unsecured notes, to be issued at <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. Proceeds will be used to repay upcoming unsecured debt maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 'BBB-'/Stable Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects its industry leadership, good cash flow and reasonable balance sheet management, enabling it to navigate the challenging department store industry and maintain market share. The ratings recognize <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> need to reposition its portfolio, including plans to close about 150 locations during 2024-2026 from a base of about 500 full-line and furniture locations as of early 2024, reflecting the challenges affecting mall-based retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and its discretionary retail peers to experience near-term operational challenges resulting from softening consumer sentiment and the evolving tariff policy. Longer term, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings assume the company can generate annual EBITDA of around $1.7 billion-$1.8 billion with EBITDAR leverage below 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Industry Leader: With $23 billion in 2024 total revenue, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the clear leader in the U.S. department store space. The company's scale, physical and digital infrastructure, cash flow, and relationships with vendors and customers are assets that, if used effectively, could allow <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to defend market share in a difficult space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has recently demonstrated some success in managing operations and expenses, with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasting EBITDA margins around the mid-8% range in the medium term, similar to 2019, despite around 10% revenue declines and the absorption of cost inflation. However, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ongoing store portfolio activity, including its target of closing about 150 locations between 2024 and 2026, underscores the shifting shopping mall landscape. Secular challenges include consumers spending less time in malls, changes to apparel buying behavior, and competition from value-oriented and online channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Focus on Productive Stores: In February 2024, new CEO Tony Spring, who previously managed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> luxury Bloomingdale's nameplate, announced several top-line initiatives and portfolio actions to drive long-term business growth. The company announced the closure of about 150 of its less-productive <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> locations through 2026, yielding a more focused and profitable group of about 350 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>-branded department stores, plus its Bloomingdale's and <span class="companylink">Bluemercury</span> divisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company indicated the stores targeted for closure generated less than 10% of net sales in 2023, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes limited EBITDA contribution. The closures could allow the company to redirect capital and management attention to its better-performing locations. The company plans to expand square footage over time through new Bloomingdale's and <span class="companylink">Bluemercury</span> locations and off-mall <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Near-Term Volatility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the U.S. retail sector to face near-term challenges, including declines in consumer sentiment, business disruption and rising costs related to evolving U.S. tariff policies. Discretionary categories could see revenue down as much as mid-single digits with outsized EBITDA declines given tariff-related cost pressure. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could see about 20% EBITDA declines in 2025 with FCF near $150 million, although the company has good liquidity to withstand near-term volatility and no material maturities before July 2027, when about $60 million of unsecured notes are due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Department Store Challenges: Mall-based retailers will continue to face secular headwinds over the longer term. Companies with scale, an omnichannel platform, including good store and supply chain infrastructure, a robust online presence, strong vendor and customer relationships, and good cash flow for business reinvestment have the best opportunities to maintain share in a difficult environment. Near-term headwinds include a soft selling environment for many discretionary goods categories, such as apparel and home, which could be exacerbated by tariffs impacting inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Relationship, Supply Chain Enhancements: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> plans to strengthen customer relationships by improving its digital platform, removing friction from the shopping experience and refreshing its assortment, including some private-label relaunches. If executed effectively, these steps could support customer loyalty and market share stabilization. However, execution risk remains somewhat elevated given secular headwinds across the regional mall landscape, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> ultimately expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> initiatives to yield flat comparable-store sales results in the medium term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDAR Leverage Below 3.0x: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> credit profile is supported by its net debt paydown of about $1.5 billion between 2020 and 2023, yielding $2.8 billion of debt today. Although the company raised its EBITDAR leverage target to at or below 2.5x (similar on a Fitch-defined basis) from at or below 2.0x, which aligns with its pre-pandemic target range of 2.3x to 2.8x, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to operate with flattish debt levels, yielding EBITDAR leverage between 2.5x and 3.0x longer term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Good Liquidity and FCF: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> FCF averaged around $150 million over the past three years and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual FCF to average around $300 million beginning 2026. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to invest around $800 million annually in capital projects is a competitive advantage, particularly given shifts in consumer behavior and a challenging competitive environment. In addition, the company's good cash flow generation supports its ability to manage through economic cycles with opportunities to improve competitive positioning, particularly if weaker players are forced to retrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis includes a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach between the parent and its subsidiaries, <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC (BBB-/Stable) and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC (BBB-/Stable). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses the quality of the overall linkage as high, which results in an equalization of IDRs across the corporate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aside from <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-rated U.S. department store coverage includes national competitors <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corporation</span> (BB-/Negative) and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc.</span> (BB/Stable), and regional player <span class="companylink">Dillard's Inc.</span> (BBB-/Positive). These retailers face industry headwinds and are continuously refining strategies to defend market share. Initiatives include investments in omnichannel models, portfolio reshaping to reduce exposure to weaker indoor malls, and enhancing merchandise assortments and service levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These initiatives have seen mixed success. Dillard's has shown the best operating trajectory with significant upside potential given its long history of underperformance. <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> and <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> have produced the weakest top-line and profitability results, while <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has experienced top-line declines mitigated by good inventory and expense management, limiting EBITDA contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> are well-positioned to accelerate investment and transformation efforts given greater relative scale and cash flow generation. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall locations and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span>'s off-price segment and high-end merchandise positioning of its full price locations should be advantages. However, both have struggled to capitalize on these strengths, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects is likely due to execution challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pre-pandemic, the three national players maintained EBITDAR leverages below 3.5x (closer to mid-2x for <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>) to support investment-grade ratings. While EBITDA is below 2019, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> leverage remains similar due to proactive debt reduction. Dillard's has lower leverage than peers due to limited debt. EBITDAR leverage is expected to be around 3x and low-4x for <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> and <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue to decline around 5% in 2025 toward high-$21 billion on negative low single digit comparable store sales and a lower store count given efforts to close about 150 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> locations between 2024 and 2026. Assuming some improvement to consumer sentiment and successful implementation of the company's top-line initiatives, revenue could improve toward mid-$22 billion in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which was $1.9 billion in 2024, could moderate to about $1.4 billion in 2025 on revenue declines and higher tariff expenses. EBITDA could rebound toward $1.6 billion in 2026 assuming sales stabilize. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes limited profit impact from store closures due to weak profitability. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to continue to source efficiency gains, which will likely be spent on top-line investments. EBITDA margins could decline to high-6% in 2025 and improve to mid-7% in 2026, lower than the 8.2% achieved in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual FCF (after dividends) is expected to be about $150 million in 2025 but improve toward $300 million range in 2026, assuming neutral working capital. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects annual capex of around $800 million, with dividends projected in the $200 million range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR leverage, which was 2.6x in 2024, could be modestly above 3.0x in 2025 given projected EBITDA declines but trend at or below 3.0x beginning 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> capital structure primarily consists of unsecured debt with fixed interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually Or Collectively, Lead To Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A downgrade to 'BB+' could result from weaker-than-expected operating results, including market share declines or margin degradation worse than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation, such that EBITDAR leverage sustained above 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually Or Collectively, Lead To Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade could occur if <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> sustained positive low-single-digit revenue and EBITDA growth, yielding EBITDAR leverage sustained below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2024 with $1.3 billion of cash and no borrowings under its $3.0 billion secured asset-backed loan (ABL) facility maturing in April 2030. Borrowings under the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) of inventory minus customary reserves. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> at 'BBB', up one notch from the IDR given its collateral package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's liquidity is supported through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast of around $300 million in FCF annually beginning 2026, after the payment of about $200 million in dividends. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects excess cash could be used for share repurchases in the context of the company's publicly articulated financial policy of maintaining EBITDAR leverage at or below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has about $2.8 billion in total unsecured debt due between 2025 and 2043. Near-term maturities are limited and include $61 million in 2027 and $176 million due 2028. The company has proposed a $500 million, eight-year unsecured notes issuance. Issued by <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC, the new notes will rank equally with existing unsecured debt, with proceeds addressing upcoming debt maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the largest department store in the U.S. with $23 billion in retail revenues in 2024 ($24 billion in total revenue including credit card fees and retail media network revenue).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-06 May 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b>, Inc.</span>'s, <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC's and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC's, Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect its industry leadership, good cash flow and reasonable balance sheet management, enabling it to navigate the challenging department store industry and maintain market share. The ratings recognize <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> need to reposition its portfolio, including plans to close about 150 locations during 2024-2026 from a base of about 500 full-line and furniture locations as of early 2024, reflecting the challenges affecting mall-based retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and its discretionary retail peers to experience near-term operational challenges resulting from softening consumer sentiment and the evolving tariff policy. Longer term, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings assume the company can generate annual EBITDA of around $1.7-$1.8 billion with EBITDAR leverage below 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Industry Leader: With $23 billion in 2024 total revenue, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the clear leader in the U.S. department store space. The company's scale, physical and digital infrastructure, cash flow, and relationships with vendors and customers are assets that, if used effectively, could allow <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to defend market share in a difficult space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has recently demonstrated some success in managing operations and expenses, with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasting EBITDA margins around the mid-8% range in the medium term, similar to 2019, despite around 10% revenue declines and the absorption of cost inflation. However, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ongoing store portfolio activity, including its target of closing about 150 locations between 2024 and 2026, underscores the shifting shopping mall landscape. Secular challenges include consumers spending less time in malls, changes to apparel buying behavior, and competition from value-oriented and online channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Focus on Productive Stores: In February 2024, new CEO Tony Spring, who previously managed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> luxury Bloomingdale's nameplate, announced a number of top-line initiatives and portfolio actions to drive long-term business growth. The company announced the closure of about 150 of its less-productive <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> locations through 2026, yielding a more focused and profitable group of about 350 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>-branded department stores, plus its Bloomingdale's and <span class="companylink">Bluemercury</span> divisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company indicated the stores targeted for closure generated less than 10% of overall revenue in 2023, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes limited EBITDA contribution. The closures could allow the company to redirect capital and management attention to its better-performing locations. The company plans to expand square footage over time through new Bloomingdale's and <span class="companylink">Bluemercury</span> locations and off-mall <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Near-Term Volatility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the U.S. retail sector to face near-term challenges, including declines in consumer sentiment, business disruption and rising costs related to evolving U.S. tariff policies. Discretionary categories could see revenue down as much as mid-single digits with outsized EBITDA declines given tariff-related cost pressure. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could see about 20% EBITDA declines in 2025 with FCF near $150 million, although the company has good liquidity to withstand near-term volatility and no material maturities before July 2027, when about $60 million of unsecured notes are due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Department Store Challenges: Mall-based retailers will continue to face secular headwinds over the longer term. Companies with scale, an omnichannel platform, including good store and supply chain infrastructure, a robust online presence, strong vendor and customer relationships, and good cash flow for business reinvestment have the best opportunities to maintain share in a difficult environment. Near-term headwinds include a soft selling environment for many discretionary goods categories, such as apparel and home, which could be exacerbated by tariffs impacting inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Customer Relationship, Supply Chain Enhancements: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> plans to strengthen customer relationships by improving its digital platform, removing friction from the shopping experience and refreshing its assortment, including some private-label relaunches. If executed effectively, these steps could support customer loyalty and market share stabilization. However, execution risk remains somewhat elevated given secular headwinds across the regional mall landscape, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> ultimately expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> initiatives to yield flat comparable-store sales results in the medium term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDAR Leverage Below 3.0x: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> credit profile is supported by its net debt paydown of about $1.5 billion between 2020 and 2023, yielding $2.8 billion of debt today. Although the company raised its EBITDAR leverage target to at or below 2.5x (similar on a Fitch-defined basis) from at or below 2.0x, which aligns with its pre-pandemic target range of 2.3x to 2.8x, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to operate with flattish debt levels, yielding EBITDAR leverage between 2.5x and 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Good Liquidity and FCF: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> FCF averaged around $150 million over the past three years and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual FCF to average around $300 million beginning 2026. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to invest around $800 million annually in capital projects is a competitive advantage, particularly given shifts in consumer behavior and a challenging competitive environment. In addition, the company's good cash flow generation supports its ability to manage through economic cycles with opportunities to improve competitive positioning, particularly if weaker players are forced to retrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis includes a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach between the parent and its subsidiaries, <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC (BBB-/Stable) and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC (BBB-/Stable). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses the quality of the overall linkage as high, which results in an equalization of IDRs across the corporate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aside from <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-rated U.S. department store coverage includes national competitors <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corporation</span> (BB-/Negative) and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc.</span> (BB/Stable), and regional player <span class="companylink">Dillard's Inc.</span> (BBB-/Positive). These retailers face industry headwinds and are continuously refining strategies to defend market share. Initiatives include investments in omnichannel models, portfolio reshaping to reduce exposure to weaker indoor malls, and enhancing merchandise assortments and service levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These initiatives have seen mixed success. Dillard's has shown the best operating trajectory with significant upside potential given its long history of underperformance. <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> and <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> have produced the weakest top-line and profitability results, while <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has experienced top-line declines mitigated by good inventory and expense management, limiting EBITDA contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> are well-positioned to accelerate investment and transformation efforts given greater relative scale and cash flow generation. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall locations and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span>'s off-price segment and high-end merchandise positioning of its full price locations should be advantages. However, both have struggled to capitalize on these strengths, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects is likely due to execution challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pre-pandemic, the three national players maintained EBITDAR leverages below 3.5x (closer to mid-2x for <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>) to support investment-grade ratings. While EBITDA is below 2019, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> leverage remains similar due to proactive debt reduction. Dillard's has lower leverage than peers due to limited debt. EBITDAR leverage is expected to be around 3x and low-4x for <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> and <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue to decline around 5% in 2025 toward high-$21 billion on negative low single digit comparable store sales and a lower store count given efforts to close about 150 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> locations between 2024 and 2026. Assuming some improvement to consumer sentiment and successful implementation of the company's top-line initiatives, revenue could improve toward mid-$22 billion in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which was $1.9 billion in 2024, could moderate to about $1.5 billion in 2025 on revenue declines and higher tariff expenses. EBITDA could rebound toward $1.6 billion in 2026 assuming sales stabilize. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes limited profit impact from store closures due to weak profitability. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to continue to source efficiency gains, which will likely be spent on top-line investments. EBITDA margins could decline to high-6% in 2025 and improve to mid-7% in 2026, lower than the 8.2% achieved in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual FCF (after dividends) is expected to be about $150 million but improve toward $300 million range in 2026, assuming neutral working capital. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects annual capex of around $800 million, with dividends projected in the $200 million range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR leverage, which was 2.6x in 2024, could be modestly above 3.0x in 2025 given projected EBITDA declines but trend below 3.0x beginning 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> capital structure primarily consists of unsecured debt with fixed interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually Or Collectively, Lead To Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A downgrade to 'BB+' could result from weaker-than-expected operating results, including market share declines or margin degradation worse than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation, such that EBITDAR leverage sustained above 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually Or Collectively, Lead To Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade could occur if <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> sustained positive low-single-digit revenue and EBITDA growth, yielding EBITDAR leverage sustained below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2024 with $1.3 billion of cash and no borrowings under its secured asset-backed loan (ABL) facility. In April 2025, the company downsized the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> to $2.1 billion from $3.0 billion given limited usage and extended the maturity to 2030 from 2027. Borrowings under the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) of inventory minus customary reserves. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> at 'BBB', up one notch from the IDR given its collateral package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's liquidity is supported through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast of around $300 million in FCF annually beginning 2026, after the payment of about $200 million in dividends. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects excess cash could be used for share repurchases in the context of the company's publicly articulated financial policy of maintaining EBITDAR leverage at or below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has about $2.8 billion in total unsecured debt due between 2025 and 2043. Near term maturities are limited and include $61 million in 2027 and $176 million due 2028. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> unsecured notes at 'BBB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-03 April 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b>, Inc.</span>'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC's and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC's Long-Term IDRs at 'BBB-' and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> senior secured <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility at 'BBB' and unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect its leading position, good cash flow and reasonable balance sheet management, which help the company navigate the challenging department store industry. The rating recognizes <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ongoing need to reposition its portfolio, including its recent announcement to close 150 of its approximately 500 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> locations, which underscores the secular challenges affecting mall-based retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has the capability to defend share longer term through its omnichannel model and ability to invest in topline initiatives. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could generate ongoing EBITDA in the $2 billion range on revenue around $23 billion over the next 24 months, albeit below pre-pandemic levels of $2.2 billion and $25 billion respectively, yielding EBITDAR leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) in the mid-2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Scaled Competitor, Challenged Space: With $23 billion in expected 2024 revenue, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the clear leader in the U.S. department store space. The company's scale, physical and digital infrastructure, cash flow, and relationships with vendors and customers are assets that, if used effectively, could allow <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to defend share in a difficult space. The company has also demonstrated some success managing operations and expenses recently, with EBITDA margins expected to trend around 9.0% in the medium term, higher than the mid-8% range from 2019 despite around 10% projected revenue declines. However, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ongoing portfolio activity, including around 90 department store closures over the past four years and plans to close another 150 locations over the next three years, underscores the shifting shopping mall landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Department stores and other mall-based retailers will continue to face secular headwinds over the longer term, including time spent in malls, changes to apparel buying behavior and encroaching competition from value-oriented and online channels. Given some reliance on private label credit card income across the group, recent rule changes to limit late fees and rhetoric around other potential changes is a newer headwind. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> credit card revenue was $619 million in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >New CEO, Updated Priorities: In February 2024, new CEO Tony Spring, who previously managed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> luxury Bloomingdale's chain, announced a number of topline initiatives and portfolio actions to drive long term business growth. The company plans to close 150 of its less productive <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> locations over the next three years, yielding a more focused and profitable group of 350 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>-branded department stores plus its Bloomingdales and Blue Mercury chains. The company has indicated the stores generate less than 10% of overall revenue and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes limited EBITDA contribution. The closures could allow the company to redirect capital and management attention to its better-performing locations. The company does plan to expand square footage over time through new Bloomingdales and Blue Mercury locations and off-mall <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Beyond these portfolio actions, the company plans to strengthen customer relationships by improving its digital platform, developing ways to remove friction from the shopping experience, and refresh its assortment including relaunching some of its private label merchandise. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is also targeting efforts to simplify its supply chain and improve operational efficiency. If executed effectively, these efforts could support customer loyalty and market share stabilization, particularly against smaller competitors with less ability to invest in similar initiatives. However, execution risk remains somewhat elevated given secular headwinds across the regional mall landscape and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> ultimately expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> initiatives to yield stagnant comparable store sales results in the medium term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Demonstrated Financial Conservatism: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> credit profile is supported by its recent actions. The company has reduced gross debt by over $1 billion since year-end 2019 and is targeting EBITDAR leverage of approximately 2.0x versus its pre-pandemic target of 2.5x to 2.8x. These actions support the company's ability to manage through future cycles while improving FCF given lower annual cash interest expense. EBITDAR leverage was 2.4x in 2023 and is projected to settle in the mid-2x range given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA forecast and stable debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Good Liquidity and FCF: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> FCF averaged around $550 million over the past five years, albeit with some volatility through the pandemic around EBITDA results and management of working capital, capex and dividends. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects annual FCF to average around $300 million beginning 2024, assuming around $1 billion of annual capex, or approximately 4% of revenue and dividends around $200 million annually. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash (with approximately $1 billion of cash at Feb. 3, 2024) to be diverted towards share repurchases, particularly after recent debt reduction and given minimal debt maturities prior to 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to invest around $1.0 billion annually in capital projects is a competitive advantage, particularly given shifts in consumer behavior and a challenging competitive environment. In addition, the company's good cash flow generation supports its ability to manage through economic cycles or extreme challenges such as the pandemic, with opportunities to improve competitive positioning, particularly if weaker players are forced to retrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Activist Shareholder: In March 2024 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> announced it has received a proposal to be acquired for $24 per share by Arkhouse Management Co. LP and Brigade Capital Management, LP; Arkhouse has also submitted a slate of Board of Directors candidates to be considered by shareholders. While Arkhouse has indicated it expects to fund its purchase with 50% equity, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> would expect any transaction to add leverage to the balance sheet and potentially reduce FCF given increased debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary Linkage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis includes a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach between the parent and its subsidiary, <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses the quality of the overall linkage as high, which results in an equalization of IDRs across the corporate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rated U.S. department store coverage includes national competitors <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc.</span> (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corp</span> (BB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc.</span> (BB/Stable), and regional player <span class="companylink">Dillard's Inc.</span> (BBB-/Stable). Each of these players contend with secular headwinds affecting the department store industry and are continuously refining strategies to defend market share. Initiatives include investments in omnichannel models, portfolio reshaping to reduce exposure to weaker indoor malls, and efforts to strengthen merchandise assortments and service levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These initiatives have had varying levels of success in recent years, with Dillard's showing the best operating trajectory albeit with the most upside potential given its long history of relative underperformance. <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> and <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> have produced the weakest results across topline and profitability while <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> results have been somewhat mixed, with topline declines mitigated by good inventory and expense management which have limited EBITDA contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Structurally, the three national players should be best positioned to accelerate investment and transformation efforts given greater relative scale and cash flow generation. In particular, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> should benefit from its off-mall real estate positioning while <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> should benefit from its exposure to the off-price segment and the higher-end merchanded positioning of its full price locations. However, neither has demonstrated an ability to capitalize on what should be fundamental advantages, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects is somewhat likely due to execution challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Prior to the pandemic, the three national players operated with EBITDAR leverage below 3.5x (closer to mid-2x for <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>) to support investment-grade ratings. Current ratings embed expectations of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> operating with leverage under 3.0x, 3.5x, and 4.0x respectively. Dillard's EBITDAR leverage is projected around 1x, modestly below pre-pandemic levels closer to 1.5x; from a rating perspective the company's low leverage is balanced by the company's relatively smaller scale and regional positioning compared with peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue could decline around 3% in 2024 toward $23 billion on flattish comparable store sales, with contraction largely due to the expected closure of around 50 stores during the year, the loss of an extra week from 2023 and some credit income declines following recent changes to late fee structures. Revenue could trend around $23 billion over the medium term, assuming the company's topline initiatives are implemented successfully to support slight comparable store sale growth offset by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> plan to close 150 stores over the next three years (including the 50 planned for 2024).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which was $2.3 billion in 2023, modestly above the $2.2 billion recorded in pre-pandemic 2019, could decline to around $2.1 billion in 2024 on lower revenue and accelerating topline investments. Beginning in 2025, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA could trend in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range, with margins in the high-8% to 9% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Annual FCF (after dividends) is expected to average in the $300 million range beginning 2024, assuming neutral working capital. Annual capex is projected around $1 billion, with dividends projected in the $200 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDAR leverage, which was 2.4x in 2023, could trend in the mid-2x range beginning in 2024 given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA projections and flat debt levels around $3 billion. This projection is below 2019 levels of 2.9x despite similar EBITDA given around $1.1 billion in debt reduction since 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> capital structure primarily consists of unsecured debt with a fixed interest rate structure. Pricing for the company's <span class="companylink">ABL</span> is based on SOFR, whose rates are forecast in the 4%-5% range over the medium term, given the higher interest rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade could occur if <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> sustained positive low-single digit revenue growth and maintained EBITDA in the mid-$2 billion range, yielding EBITDAR leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A downgrade to 'BB+' could result from weaker-than-expected operating results, including market share declines or margin degradation worse than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation, such that EBITDA trended below $2 billion and EBITDAR leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR capitalizing leases at 8x) sustained above 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity; No Near-Term Maturities: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2023 with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion and no borrowings under its $3.0 billion secured <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility maturing in March 2027 (with availability subject to a borrowing base net of LOCs). As of Feb. 3, 2024, there was $2.852 billion in borrowing capacity on the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility. The ABL facility at <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, has a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) of inventory minus customary reserves. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> at 'BBB', up one notch from the IDR given its collateral package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As of the end of 2023, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has total debt of approximately $3 billion, and the next sizable maturities are $71 million in 2027 and approximately $200 million in 2028. Between 2020 and 2022, the company paid down approximately $1.1 billion of debt from gross debt levels of $4.1 billion at the end of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has a dividend of $0.69 per share or approximately $200 million annually. The company currently has a $2 billion share authorization program in place, with approximately $1.4 billion in authorization remaining as of year-end 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the largest department store in the U.S. with $23.1 billion in retail revenues in 2023 ($23.9 billion in total revenue including credit card fees and retail media network revenue).

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-16 May 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b>, Inc</span>.'s (<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>) Long-Term IDR at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect its post-pandemic operating trajectory, which demonstrates some success in the implementation of its topline and other initiatives. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> can generate ongoing EBITDA in the low- to mid-$2 billion range over time, similar to pre-pandemic levels, yielding EBITDAR leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) in the mid-2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC's and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC's Long-Term IDRs at 'BBB-', as well as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> senior secured <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility at 'BBB' and unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Good Recent Performance Despite Volatility: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has managed relatively well through the past three volatile years. The company has demonstrated good working capital and capital structure management, while seeing some sales and margin uplift from recent initiatives around merchandising, marketing, and omnichannel platform. EBITDA in 2022 was $2.6 billion, above the $2.2 billion generated in 2019 with similar revenue levels of $25.3 billion despite industry-wide excess inventory challenges following softening spending on the casual apparel and home categories. The company also reduced gross debt to $3.0 billion at the end of 2022 from $4.1 billion at the end of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects spending on apparel and home categories to continue moderating in 2023 given ongoing shifts to consumer services and some softening of consumer health. Revenue and EBITDA could stabilize around $25 billion and $2.3 billion over the next 18 to 24 months, with low-9% margins higher than the 8.6% produced in 2019 given productivity enhancements, closures of lower-profitability stores, and reduced promotions resulting from structurally lower inventory levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Progress on Topline Initiatives: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> recent performance demonstrates some progress against secular challenges facing mall-based retailers, including department stores, given declines in time spent in malls and share shifts toward online and value channels. The company's good topline trajectory, particularly relative to department store and apparel peers, 33% digital sales penetration in 2022, and growth in customer files indicate some success in implementing various topline initiatives. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to stabilize share is further supported by competitive fallout during the pandemic and the company's ability to invest in omnichannel and other customer-facing features, which less cash flow generative competitors cannot match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has also shifted its retail exposure in recent years by net closing approximately 50 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> branded department stores over the past three years, primarily in regional malls, expanding its digital presence and opening eight off-mall <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> branded locations plus two off-mall Bloomingdales locations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to continue tilting its sales portfolio toward e-commerce and off-mall opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >However, department stores will continue to face secular headwinds over the longer term, including time spent in malls, apparel buying behavior (including ongoing trends toward casualization) and encroaching competition from value-oriented and online channels. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> recent actions and results support <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that the financially and operationally stronger players, such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, can at least maintain share in a difficult space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Demonstrated Financial Conservatism: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> good credit profile is underscored by its actions and financial flexibility over the past three years. The company has reduced gross debt by over $1 billion since year-end 2019 and is targeting EBITDAR leverage of 2.0x versus its pre-pandemic target of 2.5x to 2.8x. These actions support the company's ability to manage through future cycles while improving ongoing FCF given lower annual cash interest expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDAR leverage was 2.1x in 2022 is projected to settle in the 2.3x-2.4x range given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast of some EBITDA contraction. Increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to generate modest topline and EBITDA growth over time while maintaining leverage below 2.5x could support an upgrade of its ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity and FCF: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> FCF averaged around $500 million over the past four years, albeit with some volatility through the pandemic around EBITDA results and capex management. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to trend in the $400 million to $500 million range beginning 2023, assuming around $1 billion of annual capex, or approximately 4% of revenue. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash (with cash at $862 million at Jan. 28, 2023) to be diverted towards share repurchases, particularly after recent debt reduction and given minimal debt maturities prior to 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to invest around $1.0 billion annually in capital projects is a competitive advantage, particularly given shifts in consumer behavior and a challenging competitive environment. In addition, the company's good cash flow generation supports its ability to manage through economic cycles or extreme challenges such as the pandemic, with opportunities to improve competitive positioning, particularly if weaker players are forced to retrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary Linkage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis includes a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach between the parent and its subsidiary, <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses the quality of the overall linkage as high, which results in an equalization of IDRs across the corporate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect its position as a leading U.S. department store retailer and its ability to invest in initiatives to defend market share, including its omnichannel platform. The ratings reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation of EBITDAR leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) trending in the mid-2x over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rated U.S. department store coverage includes national competitors <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corp</span> (BBB-/Negative), <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc</span>. (BB+/Stable), and regional player <span class="companylink">Dillard's Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable). Each have developed operating and financial strategies to contend with long-term secular challenges inherent in their space. Initiatives include investments in omnichannel models, portfolio reshaping to reduce exposure to weaker indoor malls, and efforts to strengthen merchandise assortments and service levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The national players have been best positioned to accelerate investment and transformation efforts given greater relative scale and cash flow generation. Dillard's has less ability to dedicate resources to this transformation albeit is better positioned than many smaller department and specialty stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> portfolio most closely resembles a traditional department store model, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> differentiates itself via its off-mall presence and relatively higher private brand penetration. <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span>'s business model includes full-line stores, which are focused more on higher end price points and exposed primarily to A malls; the company also has a substantial off-price business to take advantage of share shifts toward this value channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Prior to the pandemic, the three national players operated with adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 3.5x (closer to mid-2x for <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>) to support investment-grade ratings. Current ratings embed expectations of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> operating with leverage under 3.0x with <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> operating under 4.0x. Dillard's EBITDAR leverage is expected to trend below 1x, below pre-pandemic levels closer to 1.5x; from a rating perspective the company's low leverage is balanced by the company's relatively smaller scale and regional positioning compared with peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> retail revenue could decline 3% to 5% in 2023 given ongoing consumer budget reallocations toward services and some general softening of consumer health. Revenue could grow in the low-single digit range beginning in 2024 assume modest growth in core categories like apparel and good execution on merchandising, omnichannel and marketing initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which moderated from $3.2 billion in 2021 to $2.6 billion in 2022 although remained above 2019 levels of $2.2 billion, could decline further toward the $2.3 billion range in 2023 given topline declines, increased promotional activity and fixed-cost deleverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA beginning 2024 could grow alongside topline expansion, with EBITDA margins sustaining in the low- to mid-9% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF (after dividends) is expected to trend in the $400 million to $500 million range beginning 2023, assuming neutral working capital beginning 2023. Annual capex is planned around $1 billion, lower than the $1.3 billion spent in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which was 2.1x in 2022 could climb to the 2.3x-2.4x range beginning in 2023 given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA projections and flat debt levels around $3 billion. This projection is below 2019 levels of 2.9x despite similar EBITDA given around $1.1 billion in debt reduction since 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The company's outstanding debt of approximately $3.0 billion consists of fixed rate unsecured notes. The company's <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility, currently undrawn as of Jan. 28, 2023 is priced at SOFR + 1.5%. Variable SOFR rates are in the 4%-5% range over the forecast horizon, given the higher interest rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade would occur if <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> sustained positive low-single digit revenue growth and maintained EBITDA in the mid-$2 billion range, yielding EBITDAR leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A downgrade to 'BB+' could result from weaker-than-expected operating results, including market share declines or margin degradation worse than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation, such that EBITDA trended below $2 billion and EBITDAR leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR capitalizing leases at 8x) sustained above 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-14 March 2022: LEAD PARAGRAPH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This is a correction of a release originally published March 2, 2022. It amends the Rating Outlook for <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> in the Derivation Summary to Negative from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to $850 million of proposed new notes (in equal eight- and 10-year tranches) at <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC (MRH). Proceeds from the issuance, alongside approximately $350 million of cash would be used to repay approximately $1.1 billion of unsecured notes due 2023/2024 plus transaction fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 'BBB-' rating and Stable Outlook reflect its recently strong operating trajectory, which demonstrates some success in implementation of its topline and other initiatives. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> can generate ongoing EBITDA in the low-$2 billion range beginning 2022, similar to pre-pandemic levels, yielding adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) in the mid-2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Rebound: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> strong 2021 results, including sequential revenue growth improvement and nearly 50% EBITDA growth (to $3.2 billion) from 2019 levels on good cost control and reduced promotional activity, has improved <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s confidence that ongoing EBITDA could settle close to pre-pandemic levels in the low-$2 billion range. Revenue trajectory during the year improved from a 14% decline relative to 2019 in 1Q to around 4% growth by 4Q, resulting in overall revenue of $25 billion, close to 2019 levels. Good revenue performance in 2021 is likely the result of both improvements in the selling environment (chiefly pandemic-challenged categories like apparel and cosmetics) and successful implementation of topline initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue could stabilize at around $25 billion beginning 2022, as omnichannel sales growth offsets ongoing mall traffic challenges. EBITDA could decline toward pre-pandemic levels in the low-to-mid $2 billion range, assuming EBITDA margin in the 8%-9% (versus 12.7% in 2021) given some reversal in the currently moderate promotional environment and increased selling investments to support its omnichannel initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Progress on Topline Initiatives: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2021 performance demonstrates some progress against secular challenges facing mall-based retailers, including department stores, given declines in time spent in malls and share shifts toward online and value channels. The company's positive topline trajectory, 35% digital sales penetration in 2021, and growth in customer files indicate some success in implementing various topline initiatives. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to stabilize share is further supported by some competitive fallout during the pandemic and the company's ability to invest in omnichannel and other customer-facing features, which less cash flow generative competitors cannot match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Department stores will continue to face secular headwinds over the longer term, including time spent in malls, apparel buying behavior (including ongoing trends toward casualization) and encroaching competition from value-oriented and online channels. However, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> recent actions and results support <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that the financially and operationally stronger players, such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, can at least maintain share in a difficult space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Demonstrated Financial Conservatism: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> good credit profile is underscored by its actions and financial flexibility since the beginning of the pandemic. In addition to aggressive reductions to operating expenses, capex, and inventory and the suspension of its dividend at the onset of the pandemic, the company net reduced debt by around $850 million from the end of 2019 to the end of 2021 and plans to net pay down around $300 million with the current proposed transaction. The company also recently reduced its adjusted leverage target to 2.0x from its pre-pandemic range of 2.5x to 2.8x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> balance sheet actions over the past two years, including the proposed refinancing, will reduce pro forma debt levels to around $3 billion from $4.2 billion at the end of 2019. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> therefore expects adjusted leverage to trend in the mid-2x range beginning 2022 relative to nearly 3x in 2019 despite similar (projected) EBITDA levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity and FCF: The company generated approximately $2 billion in FCF in 2021 on strong EBITDA and below-average spend on capex of approximately $600 million. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to be close to breakeven over the next two years given its EBITDA projections in the low $2 billion range and materially higher capex. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expects to spend $1 billion in capex in 2022, significantly higher than the approximately $600 million in 2021. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash (with cash at $1.7 billion at Jan. 29, 2022) to be diverted towards share repurchases, given a new $2 billion share authorization program and minimal debt maturities prior to 2027 following the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to invest around $1.0 billion annually in capital projects is a competitive advantage, particularly given shifts in consumer behavior and a challenging competitive environment. In addition, the company's good cash flow generation supports its ability to manage through economic cycles or extreme challenges such as the pandemic, with some opportunity to improve competitive positioning particularly if weaker players are forced to retrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary Linkage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis includes a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach between the parent and its subsidiary <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses the quality of the overall linkage as high that results in an equalization of IDRs across the corporate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rated U.S. department store coverage includes national competitors <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohls Corp</span> (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc</span>. (BBB-/Negative), and regional player <span class="companylink">Dillard's Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable). Each have developed operating and financial strategies to contend with long-term secular challenges inherent in their space. Initiatives include investments in omnichannel models, portfolio reshaping to reduce exposure to weaker indoor malls, and efforts to strengthen merchandise assortments and service levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The national players have been best positioned to accelerate investment and transformation efforts given greater relative scale and cash flow generation. Dillard's has less ability to dedicate resources to this transformation albeit is better positioned than many smaller department and specialty stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> portfolio most closely resembles a traditional department store model, <span class="companylink">Kohls</span> differentiates itself via its off-mall presence and relatively higher private brand penetration. <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span>'s business model includes full-line stores, which are focused more on higher-end price points and exposed primarily to A malls; the company also has a substantial off-price business to take advantage of share shifts toward this value channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Prior to the pandemic, the three national players operated with adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 3.5x (closer to mid-2x for <span class="companylink">Kohls</span>) to support investment grade ratings. Over the medium term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Kohls</span> could operate with leverage in the mid-2x with <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> modestly higher at above 3x. Reduced leverage at <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> relative to pre-pandemic is largely due to proactive debt reduction. Dillard's adjusted leverage is projected around 1x, modestly below pre-pandemic levels closer to 1.5x; from a rating perspective the company's low leverage is balanced by the company's relatively smaller scale and regional positioning compared with peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> retail revenue beginning 2022 could stabilize at around $25 billion, modestly above the approximately $24.5 billion recorded in both 2021 and pre-pandemic 2019. Stable topline is expected to result from ongoing growth in digital revenue offset by modest declines in store-originated volume. Credit revenue is projected around $750 million to $800 million annually, similar to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which improved to $3.2 billion in 2021 from $2.2 billion in pre-pandemic 2019, could moderate to the low $2 billion beginning 2022 on EBITDA margin of 8%-9% on more normalized gross margins, and SG&A increases relative to 2021 to support investments in its omnichannel initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to be close to breakeven over the next two years given its EBITDA projections in the low $2 billion range and materially higher capex. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expects to spend $1 billion in capex in 2022, significantly higher than the approximately $600 million in 2021. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash (with cash at $1.7 billion at Jan 29, 2022) to be largely diverted towards share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which was 1.8x in 2021 on strong operating results, could moderate to the mid-2x beginning 2022 given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA projections. This projection is below 2019 levels of 2.9x despite similar EBITDA given around $850 million in debt reduction through the end of 2021 and approximately $300 million net reduction projected in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could see a one-notch upgrade to 'BBB' if EBITDA margin is sustained above 10% with EBITDA in the mid-to-high $2 billion range, resulting in adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A downgrade to 'BB+' could result from weaker-than-expected operating results, including market share declines or margin degradation worse than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation, such that EBITDA trended below $2 billion and adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR capitalizing leases at 8x) sustained above 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2021 with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no borrowings under its $2.941 billion secured ABL facility maturing May 9, 2024 (with availability subject to a borrowing base net of LOCs). The ABL facility at <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, has a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the ABL facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) of inventory minus customary reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expects to issue $850 million in senior unsecured notes which along with cash on hand, will be used to redeem the entirety of $1.1 billion of debt maturing in 2023 and 2024 including $81 million of second lien notes due 2024. Post this refinancing the company will have total debt of $3 billion with the next sizable maturity of $71 million in 2027 and approximately $200 million in 2028.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2021, the company reinstated a dividend at $0.60 per share or approximately $180 million annually and announced a share authorization program of $500 million (the first since 2016), which was largely completed in 2021, with a new $2 billion share authorization program put in place. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expects to spend $1 billion in capex in 2022, significantly higher than the approximately $600 million in 2021. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to be close to breakeven over the next two years given its EBITDA projections in the low $2 billion range. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash to be diverted towards share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the largest department store in the U.S. with $24.6 billion in retail revenues in 2021 across its digital presence and network of around 550 department stores plus other retail formats.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-22 February 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>., <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. (MRH) and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The upgrade reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> recent strong topline trajectory, which provides some evidence of successful implementation of omnichannel and other topline initiatives. These efforts, alongside good cost reduction and balance sheet management, have improved <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain EBITDA at least near pre-pandemic levels in the low-$2 billion range and adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) in the mid-2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> reported 2021 EBITDA at $3.2 billion, above the $2.2 billion reported in 2019 on EBITDA margins of 12.7% versus 8.6% pre-pandemic. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EBITDA beginning 2022 could trend towards low $2 billion on EBITDA margin of 8%-9% on more normalized gross margins, and SG&A increases relative to 2021 to support investments in its omnichannel initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Rebound: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> strong 2021 results, including sequential revenue growth improvement and nearly 50% EBITDA growth (to $3.2 billion) from 2019 levels on good cost control and reduced promotional activity, has improved <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s confidence that ongoing EBITDA could settle close to pre-pandemic levels in the low-$2 billion range. Revenue trajectory during the year improved from a 14% decline relative to 2019 in 1Q to around 4% growth by 4Q, resulting in overall revenue of $25 billion, close to 2019 levels. Good revenue performance in 2021 is likely the result of both improvements in the selling environment (chiefly pandemic-challenged categories like apparel and cosmetics) and successful implementation of topline initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue could stabilize at around $25 billion beginning 2022, as omnichannel sales growth offsets ongoing mall traffic challenges. EBITDA could decline toward pre-pandemic levels in the low-to-mid $2 billion range, assuming EBITDA margin in the 8%-9% (versus 12.7% in 2021) given some reversal in the currently moderate promotional environment and increased selling investments to support its omnichannel initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Progress on Topline Initiatives: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2021 performance demonstrates some progress against secular challenges facing mall-based retailers, including department stores, given declines in time spent in malls and share shifts toward online and value channels. The company's positive topline trajectory, 35% digital sales penetration in 2021, and growth in customer files indicate some success in implementing various topline initiatives. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to stabilize share is further supported by some competitive fallout during the pandemic and the company's ability to invest in omnichannel and other customer-facing features, which less cash flow generative competitors cannot match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> recognizes that department stores will continue to face secular headwinds over the longer term, including time spent in malls, apparel buying behavior (including ongoing trends toward casualization) and encroaching competition from value-oriented and online channels. However, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> recent actions and results support <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that the financially and operationally stronger players, such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, can at least maintain share in a difficult space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Demonstrated Financial Conservatism: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> good credit profile is underscored by its actions and financial flexibility since the beginning of the pandemic. In addition to aggressive reductions to operating expenses, capex, and inventory and the suspension of its dividend at the onset of the pandemic, the company net reduced debt by around $850 million from the end of 2019 to the end of 2021. The company also recently reduced its adjusted leverage target to 2.0x from its pre-pandemic range of 2.5x to 2.8x. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects adjusted leverage to trend in the mid-2x range beginning 2022 relative to nearly 3x in 2019 despite similar (projected) EBITDA levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity and FCF: The company generated approximately $2 billion in FCF in 2021 on strong EBITDA and below-average spend on capex of approximately $600 million. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to be close to breakeven over the next two years given its EBITDA projections in the low $2 billion range and materially higher capex. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expects to spend $1 billion in capex in 2022, significantly higher than the approximately $600 million in 2021. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash (with cash at $1.7 billion at Jan 29, 2022) to largely be diverted towards share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to invest around $1.0 billion annually in capital projects is a competitive advantage, particularly given shifts in consumer behavior and a challenging competitive environment. In addition, the company's good cash flow generation supports its ability to manage through economic cycles or extreme challenges such as the pandemic, with some opportunity to improve competitive positioning particularly if weaker players are forced to retrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary Linkage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s analysis includes a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach between the parent and its subsidiary <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses the quality of the overall linkage as high that results in an equalization of IDRs across the corporate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> upgrade to 'BBB-'/Outlook Stable reflects its recent strong topline trajectory, which provides some evidence of successful implementation of omnichannel and other topline initiatives. These efforts, alongside good cost reduction and balance sheet management, have improved <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain EBITDA at least near pre-pandemic levels in the low-$2 billion range and adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) in the mid-2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rated U.S. department store coverage includes national competitors <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohls Corp</span> (BBB-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc</span>. (BBB-/Negative), and regional player <span class="companylink">Dillard's Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable). Each have developed operating and financial strategies to contend with long-term secular challenges inherent in their space. Initiatives include investments in omnichannel models, portfolio reshaping to reduce exposure to weaker indoor malls, and efforts to strengthen merchandise assortments and service levels. The national players have been best positioned to accelerate investment and transformation efforts given greater relative scale and cash flow generation. Dillard's has less ability to dedicate resources to this transformation albeit is better positioned than many smaller department and specialty stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> portfolio most closely resembles a traditional department store model, <span class="companylink">Kohls</span> differentiates itself via its off-mall presence and relatively higher private brand penetration. <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span>'s business model includes full-line stores, which are focused more on higher-end price points and exposed primarily to A malls; the company also has a substantial off-price business to take advantage of share shifts toward this value channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Prior to the pandemic, the three national players operated with adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 3.5x (closer to mid-2x for <span class="companylink">Kohls</span>) to support investment grade ratings. Over the medium term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Kohls</span> could operate with leverage in the mid-2x with <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> modestly higher at above 3x. Reduced leverage at <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> relative to pre-pandemic is largely due to proactive debt reduction. Dillard's adjusted leverage is projected around 1x, modestly below pre-pandemic levels closer to 1.5x; from a rating perspective the company's low leverage is balanced by the company's relatively smaller scale and regional positioning compared with peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> retail revenue beginning 2022 could stabilize at around $25 billion, modestly above the approximately $24.5 billion recorded in both 2021 and pre-pandemic 2019. Stable topline is expected to result from ongoing growth in digital revenue offset by modest declines in store-originated volume. Credit revenue is projected around $750 million to $800 million annually, similar to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which improved to $3.2 billion in 2021 from $2.2 billion in pre-pandemic 2019, could moderate to the low $2 billion beginning 2022 on EBITDA margin of 8%-9% on more normalized gross margins, and SG&A increases relative to 2021 to support investments in its omnichannel initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to be close to breakeven over the next two years given its EBITDA projections in the low $2 billion range and materially higher capex. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expects to spend $1 billion in capex in 2022, significantly higher than the approximately $600 million in 2021. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash (with cash at $1.7 billion at Jan 29, 2022) to be largely diverted towards share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which was 1.8x in 2021 on strong operating results, could moderate to the mid-2x beginning 2022 given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s EBITDA projections. This projection is below 2019 levels of 2.9x despite similar EBITDA given around $850 million in debt reduction through the end of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could see a one-notch upgrade to 'BBB' if EBITDA margin is sustained above 10% with EBITDA in the mid-to-high $2 billion range, resulting in adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR, capitalizing leases at 8x) below 2.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A downgrade to 'BB+' could result from weaker-than-expected operating results, including market share declines or margin degradation worse than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation, such that EBITDA trended below $2 billion and adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR capitalizing leases at 8x) sustained above 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2021 with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no borrowings under its $2.941 billion secured ABL facility maturing May 9, 2024 (with availability subject to a borrowing base net of LOCs). The ABL facility at <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, has a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the ABL facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) of inventory minus customary reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2021, the company reinstated a dividend at $0.60 per share or approximately $180 million annually and announced a share authorization program of $500 million (the first since 2016) which was largely completed in 2021, with a new $2 billion share authorization program put in place. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expects to spend $1 billion in capex in 2022, significantly higher than the approximately $600 million in 2021. As a result, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF to be close to breakeven over the next two years given its EBITDA projections in the low $2 billion range. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects any excess cash to be diverted towards share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As part of its actions, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has upgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ABL to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'/'RR1' and all of its second lien and unsecured notes to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'/'RR4'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the largest department store in the U.S. with $24.6 billion in retail revenues in 2021 across its digital presence and network of around 550 department stores plus other retail formats.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-25 August 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>., <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. (MRH) and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC to 'BB+' from 'BB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The upgrade reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> improving topline trajectory and strong cost reduction. Fitch projects 2021 EBITDA to be at or above $2.5 billion on significantly improved EBITDA margin at 10.4% versus 8.6% pre-pandemic. Fitch expects EBITDA beginning 2022 to be around $2 billion on EBITDA margin of 8% on more normalized gross margins, and SG&A increases relative to 2021 to support investments in its omnichannel initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> recent redemption of its $1.3 billion in senior secured notes has improved Fitch's confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain adjusted leverage under 3x. Increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain low single digit positive comps, EBITDA growth of at least low single digits, and EBITDA margin sustained above 10% would be a rating positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> is withdrawing the Short-term IDR and commercial paper ratings at MRH as it is no longer considered by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> to be relevant to the agency's coverage because the CP program is not currently active.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Rebound: <b>Macy's</b> EBITDA has rebounded sharply, with 1H21 EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion, over 60% higher than the comparable 2019 results. Revenue in 2Q21 increased 2% versus 2019, a significant improvement compared to a 14% decline in the first quarter. 2Q21 EBITDA margin at 13.9% and 1Q21 EBITDA margin at 9.3% were significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels of 7%, due to increased full pricing selling and low clearance activity on reduced inventory purchases (inventory down 27% at the end of 4Q20 and 23% at 1Q21 relative to comparable 2019 levels) and significant expense reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch projects revenue could reach $23.5 billion in 2021 versus $17.3 billion in 2020, and $24.6 billion in 2019, reflecting strong comp recovery offset somewhat by lost revenue from closed stores. Revenue beginning 2022 is expected to stabilize at this level assuming low single digit comp increases offset by lost revenue from continued store closings, as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> completes its targeted 125 store closings announced in Feb. 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch expects EBITDA margins in 2021 to be in the low double digits, given the dynamics described above, Fitch expects EBITDA margin to moderate to around 8% in 2022, on more normalized gross margins in the 39.5%-40% range, as inventory levels build up and SG&A increases relative to 2021 levels to support ongoing investments in its omnichannel initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch recognizes that a number of unknowns remain, including the levels of pent-up and pull-forward demand, which may have benefitted 1H21 apparel and accessories sales, and the potential impact of rising delta variant coronavirus cases on consumer behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Longer Term Pandemic Impacts: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> initiatives and competitor actions during the pandemic could benefit leaders in the apparel and accessories space and improve the company's revenue prospects in the medium term, although this could be offset by continued secular shifts that have reduced mall traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> continued to execute against its $1.5 billion cost reduction program, which is designed to provide <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> with reinvestment opportunity in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> digital business, strengthening customer relationships, in-store enhancements, and private label expansion. The company benefited from its accelerated omnichannel investment. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> currently expects digital sales to be around $8.4 billion or 35% of its 2021 forecast sales versus 25% of sales in 2019, but expects the business to grow to $10 billion by 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company previously announced the closure of 125 (accounted for about $1.4 billion or less than 10% of 2019 revenue and generated minimal EBITDA) of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> lower-volume locations, primarily in secondary or tertiary markets, which will be completed by 2022. Post closures, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores will decline to around 400 locations from about 520 stores at the end of 3Q19, and will account for 93% of store revenue and 88% of stores going forward, with close to 85% of the locations located in A and B rated malls. Overall, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> branded stores account for 88% of total company revenue with the remaining 12% coming from Bloomingdales and Bluemercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Reduced industry square footage, due to store closures from strong and weaker players, as well as larger scale retrenchment by, or even elimination of, struggling industry participants, should lead to lower industry-wide inventory levels of apparel and accessories, which could structurally reduce industry markdown activity, and protect market share of industry leaders both in the mall and off-mall channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch acknowledges <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> proactive approach to real estate portfolio rationalization and efforts to invest in defending share, the heightened retrenchment of the store base and cost cutting required to stabilize operations is evidence of the dislocation in the business and ongoing secular pressure in the department store space. Longer term, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to stabilize its share of the mid-tier apparel, accessories and home space will depend on execution against its omnichannel and other growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Demonstrated Financial Conservatism and Flexibility: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> good credit profile is underscored by its actions and financial flexibility since the beginning of the pandemic. The company maximized near-term cash flow through payables negotiations, lower inventory buys and significantly reducing capex to $470 million in 2020 from its initially targeted $1 billion. The company announced an incremental $630 million of annual savings from restructuring and cost cutting, on top of the $1.5 billion announced as part of its restructuring plan in February 2020, and suspended its dividend ($1.51 per share or approximately $470 million annually) beginning the second quarter of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the strong cash generation, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> repaid the $1.3 billion of senior secured notes in August 2021 it had issued mid-2020. The company reinstated a dividend at $0.60 per share or approximately $180 million annually and announced a share authorization program of $500 million (the first since 2016), which Fitch expects will be completed in 2021. Capex in 2022 is expected to return to $1 billion from $650 million projected in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> financial discipline and adherence to its publicly stated financial policy (leverage of 2.5x to 2.8x, or 2.4x to 2.7x on a Fitch-calculated basis) has supported the company's credit profile over the past few years, and Fitch expects adjusted debt/EBITDA to return to under 3x beginning 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> BB+/Stable ratings reflect its improving topline trajectory and strong cost reduction. Fitch projected 2021 EBITDA is expected to be at or above $2.5 billion on significantly improved EBITDA margin at 10.4%. Fitch expects EBITDA beginning 2022 to be around $2 billion on EBITDA margin of 8% on more normalized gross margins and SG&A increases relative to 2021 to support ongoing investments in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> omnichannel initiatives. In addition, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> recent redemption of its $1.3 billion senior secured notes have improved Fitch's view in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain adjusted leverage under 3x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings consider its position as the largest department store chain in the U.S. Results in recent years have been pressured given long-term weak mall traffic trends and heightened competition from alternate channels. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to stabilize its share of the mid-tier apparel, accessories and home space will depend on execution against its omnichannel and other growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> (BBB-/Stable): <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> ratings reflect its position as the second largest department store in the U.S. and its well-developed omnichannel strategies, with digital sales expected to contribute to approximately 35% of revenues going forward. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall real estate footprint provides some insulation from mall traffic challenges. Assuming a sustained topline recovery, EBITDA could return to 2019 levels of $2.5 billion and adjusted debt/EBITDAR could return to under 3x in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nordstrom (BBB-/Negative): Nordstrom's ratings reflect its historically good market position in the apparel, footwear, and accessories space, with its differentiated merchandise and high level of customer service enabling the company to enjoy strong customer loyalty. However, the Negative Outlook reflects concerns that recent pre-pandemic operating challenges could suggest some combination of execution shortfalls and increased susceptibility to secular headwinds in the department store space, which could limit the company's ability to return revenue and profitability close to pre-pandemic levels. Nordstrom's ability to sustain its 'BBB-' rating would depend on the operating rebound potential through 2022, with increased confidence in Nordstrom's ability to achieve Fitch's projections and bring adjusted leverage to under 3.5x through both EBITDA expansion and debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's (BB+/Positive): Dillard's ratings reflect its improving topline trajectory and strong cost reduction, with Fitch projecting 2021 EBITDA to be at or above $800 million on significantly improved EBITDA margin at 13.1% versus 6.2% pre-pandemic. Fitch expects EBITDA beginning 2022 to be around $500 million annually on EBITDA margin of 8%-8.5%, on more normalized gross margins in the 34% range and SG&A increases to support ongoing investments in its omnichannel initiatives. Increased confidence in Fitch's projections of sustained low single digit positive comps, EBITDA above $500 million with EBITDA margin in the high single digits could lead to a positive rating action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's ratings reflect the company's historical lower operating profitability, geographical concentration and low ecommerce penetration relative to its larger department store peers, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>. The ratings also consider Dillard's strong liquidity, FCF and minimal debt maturities, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR expected to trend in the low to mid 1x</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2021 net sales could increase approximately 35% to $23.5 billion from depressed 2020 levels, assuming revenue in the second half of 2021 is down low single digits relative to 2019 levels versus up 2% in 2Q21 and down 14% in 1Q21. Sales growth is expected to stabilize at this level beginning 2022 with low single digit comps offset by sales loss from ongoing store closures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which was essentially breakeven in 2020 relative to approximately $2.2 billion in 2019, could improve toward $2.5 billion in 2021 on sales recovery, strong gross margin due to low inventory levels and better than expected recovery in demand and strong expense reduction. EBITDA margins in 2021 are expected to be around 10.4%, above the 8.6% reported in 2019 due to these factors. EBITDA could trend towards $2 billion in 2022 on high single digit EBITDA margins assuming some gross margin moderation to the mid-39% range and SG&A expense increases from 2021 (but still 5% lower than 2019 levels);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF (after recently reinstated dividends of $180 million annually) is expected to be $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion in 2021, given Fitch's EBITDA projections. FCF could be around $250 million beginning 2022 assuming EBITDA levels of $2 billion and increased capex of $1 billion annually versus $650 million projected in 2021. Fitch expects $500 million in share buybacks in 2021 and assumes FCF beginning 2022 will be directed towards share buybacks;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR is projected to be in the low 2x in 2021 and high 2x beginning 2022 on EBITDA recovery and the recent paydown of $1.3 billion of secured debt and paydown of $294 million debt maturing in January 2022. This compares to leverage of 2.9x in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--For an upgrade to 'BBB-', increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain low single digit positive comps, EBITDA growth of at least low single digits, and EBITDA margin sustained above 10%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Maintaining adjusted debt/EBITDAR under 3.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Reduced confidence in the company's longer-term business profile or ability to stabilize its operating trajectory, as evidenced by declines in revenue in the low single digits and EBITDA trending well below $2 billion and EBITDA margin trending towards the mid-single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 4x would also be a rating concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2020 with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no borrowings under its $2.941 billion secured ABL facility (with availability subject to a borrowing base net of letters of credit). The company put in place a $2.941 billion ABL facility and a $300 million short-term bridge revolving facility (matured in December 2020) in June 2020, that replaced the existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility with the same maturity of May 9, 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $2.941 billion ABL facility at a newly created SPV, <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, has a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the ABL facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of NOLV of inventory minus customary reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company also issued $1.3 billion of senior secured notes collateralized by certain real estate assets in June 2020. The real estate collateral for the secured notes were transferred to a newly created Propco. It included three flagship stores (Union Square, San Francisco; Brooklyn, New York; and State Street, Chicago), 35 full-line mall locations (33 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and two Bloomingdales) in 'A' rated malls, and 10 distribution centers. The $365 million in notes issued by MRH in July 2020 are secured by a second-priority lien on the same collateral securing the $1.3 billion senior secured notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> owns a considerable amount of real estate, including 389 (298 owned and 91 ground leased) of its 507 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores and 21 (14 owned and seven ground leased) of its 35 Bloomingdales full line stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In March 2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> issued $500 million of new unsecured notes due 2029, the proceeds of which were used to tender approximately $500 million of debt maturing between 2022 and 2025. The company now has $294 million of debt maturing in 2022, $665 million in 2023, and $468 million in 2024. Fitch expects the remaining balance on the January 2022 maturity post the bond transaction to be paid down with cash on hand; <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could choose to refinance or pay down 2023/2024 maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given the strong cash generation, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> repaid the $1.3 billion of senior secured notes in August 2021it had issued mid-2020. The company reinstated a dividend at $0.60 per share or approximately $180 million annually and announced a share authorization program of $500 million (the first since 2016) which Fitch expects will be completed in 2021. Capex in 2022 is expected to return to $1 billion from $650 million projected in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not employ a waterfall recovery analysis for issuers assigned ratings in the 'BB' category. The further up the speculative-grade continuum a rating moves, the more compressed the notching between the specific classes of issuances becomes. The $2.941 billion secured ABL facility has been affirmed at 'BBB-'/'RR1', indicating outstanding recovery prospects (91%-100%). The $360 million second lien secured notes due 2024 to 2034 and the unsecured notes have been upgraded to 'BB+'/'RR4' from 'BB/RR4', indicating average (31%-50%) recovery prospects. All non-first lien debt is capped at 'RR4' for generic ratings under Fitch's revised corporate recovery ratings and instrument ratings criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is the largest department store in the U.S. with $25 billion in revenues in 2019 that dropped to $17 billion in 2020 due to the severe impact of the pandemic. As of July 31, the company operated 507 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores, 54 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> furniture and furniture clearance stores, 7 standalone Backstage stores, 56 Bloomingdale's stores (including 20 outlet locations and 1 furniture stores) and 160 Bluemercury stores.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-20 April 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>., <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. (MRH) and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC at 'BB'. Fitch has revised the ratings on the $360 million total second lien notes due 2024 to 2034 under MRH to 'BB/RR4' from 'BB/RR3' and the $1.3 billion first lien secured notes at <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. to 'BB+/RR2' from 'BB+/RR1', reflecting Fitch's revised corporate recovery ratings and instrument ratings criteria. The Rating Outlook is Negative. The ratings have been removed from Under Criteria Observation (UCO), where they were placed following the publication of the updated recovery ratings criteria on April 9, 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >More information on our new criteria approach is available at https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/corporates-recovery-ratings-instrument-ratings-criteria-09-04-2021[https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/corporates-recovery-ratings-instrument-ratings-criteria-09-04-2021].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect the significant business interruption resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and changes in consumer behavior, which have materially reduced sales of apparel and accessories, while the Negative Rating Outlook reflects uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of a recovery in operating momentum. Increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to achieve Fitch's projections of EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2022 and reduce adjusted leverage to the low 4x would lead to a stabilization in Fitch's Rating Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sales Disruption from the Coronavirus Pandemic: The pandemic has severely affected revenue trajectories in categories like apparel, due to mandated or proactive store closures, and weak traffic at retailers of apparel and accessories given reduced wardrobe replenishment needs from declines in social gatherings and increased remote work arrangements. Numerous unknowns remain, including the pace of vaccine deployment, economic conditions exiting the pandemic including lingering unemployment and household income trends, the impact of potential additional government spending support, and the lasting effects the crisis will on have on long-term consumer behavior. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2020 net sales declined 30% to $17.3 billion, with minimal EBITDA generation as sales deleveraging, significant inventory markdowns in 1H20 and increased delivery expenses from the shift to digital weighed heavily on margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Business Model Evolution: While most U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers are battling competitive incursion from online and value-oriented players, sales weakness has been most pronounced for mid-tier apparel and accessories retailers. While leading players such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and Nordstrom have been able to largely offset decline in in-store sales through the growth in their e-commerce businesses pre-pandemic, retailers had to invest heavily in omnichannel platforms, which have driven down EBITDA margins and reduced cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financially and operationally stronger department stores should be able to at least maintain their share of the apparel and accessories space over the longer term. These companies are expected to benefit from store closings and restructuring activity from cash-constrained specialty apparel players and department stores which accelerated in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Intensified Strategy Highlights Secular Challenges: Management announced a three-year plan in February 2020, which accelerates its strategy of real estate rationalization, cost structure optimization and targeted business re-investment in its digital business, store-related growth strategies, its relaunched loyalty program and expansion of Bluemercury and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> Backstage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Major elements of the plan include the closure of 125 (or around 20%) of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> lower-volume stores, primarily in secondary or tertiary markets, to focus management attention on its best performing assets. Post closures, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores will decline to about 450 units from about 580 stores at the end of 3Q19 and will account for 93% of store revenue and 88% of stores going forward, with close to 85% of the locations located in A and B rated malls. Overall, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> branded stores account for 89% of total company revenue with the remaining 11% coming from Bloomingdales and Bluemercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> announced a target of $1.5 billion in reductions to its cost structure in February 2020 and increased that target to $2.1 billion in September 2020. The company has targeted major savings in areas like supply chain optimization, store expense reduction and marketing expense efficiency. Gross margin opportunities total $600 million, while SG&A opportunities account for the remaining $1.5 billion. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> exited 2020 achieving $900 million of the targeted SG&A reductions with some gross margin benefits from efforts to improve merchandise mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> e-commerce business was around $6 billion, or 25% of sales in 2019, and grew to $7.7 billion in 2020, or nearly 45%, of sales given the significant shift to online as a result of temporary store closures and a reduction in traffic due to the pandemic. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> currently expects digital sales to be $7 billion, or 35%, of 2021 forecasted sales but expects the business to grow to $10 billion by 2023 and account for over 40% of its total business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch acknowledges <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> proactive approach to real estate portfolio rationalization and efforts to invest in defending share, the heightened retrenchment of the store base and cost cutting required to stabilize operations is evidence of the dislocation in the business and ongoing secular pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Declines Pre-Pandemic: EBITDA in 2019 declined 13% to $2.2 billion given a 0.8% comparable store sales decline and margin declining to 8.6% from 9.8% in 2018. Prior to the recent disruption, Fitch had expected merchandise revenue to decline below $23 billion by 2022 from a 2019 base of $24.5 billion on modest comp declines and store closures, and for EBITDA to decline under $2.0 billion despite cost reduction efforts. Fitch now expects revenue to be $21 billion to $22 billion in 2022/2023 with EBITDA trending toward the mid-$1 billion range on EBITDA margins in the 7%-8% range given a gradual recovery in apparel and accessories sales entering 2022. The company is targeting low single digit comp growth, with double-digit growth in digital sales offset by low-to-mid single-digit declines in store level sales and EBITDA margin moving into the high single digits compared with 10% in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> financial discipline and adherence to its publicly stated financial policy (leverage of 2.5x to 2.8x, or 2.4x to 2.7x on a Fitch-calculated basis) has supported the company's credit profile over the past few years. The company is targeting leverage to return under 3x, but Fitch expects it could be well outside of this range over the next couple of years given an anticipated slow recovery in apparel and accessories sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> (BB/Negative): <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect the significant business interruption resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and changes in consumer behavior, which have materially reduced sales of apparel and accessories, while the Negative Rating Outlook reflects uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of a recovery in operating momentum. Adjusted leverage is expected to be in the mid-4x range in 2021, assuming net retail sales of $19.7 billion, a 20% decline from 2019 levels, and EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion. Leverage could return to the low 4x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery and EBITDA close to $1.5 billion and further debt paydown. Increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to achieve Fitch's projections would lead to a stabilization in our Ratings Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings continue to reflect its position as the largest department store chain in the U.S. and Fitch's view of a prolonged timeframe for the company's operating trajectory to stabilize on a lower EBITDA base given weak mall traffic and heightened competition from alternate channels that include online and off-price. This follows sustained low single digit comparable store sales declines, recent EBITDA margins well below expectations and increased management urgency to address secular challenges, as evidenced by the announcement of 125 store closures and $1.5 billion in cost reductions to support business reinvestment, prior to the recent downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> (BBB-/Stable): <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> ratings reflect its position as the second largest department store in the U.S. and its well-developed omnichannel strategies, with digital sales expected to contribute to approximately 35% of revenues going forward. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall real estate footprint provides some insulation from mall traffic challenges. The Stable Rating Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that 2021 adjusted debt/EBITDAR will trend in the low 3x range on projected Fitch calculated EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion and $600 million in net debt reduction. Adjusted debt/EBITDAR could return to under 3x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery and EBITDA increasing to around $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's (BB/Negative): Dillard's ratings reflect the company's below-industry-average sales productivity (as measured by sales psf), operating profitability and geographical concentration relative to its larger department store peers, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>. The ratings consider Dillard's strong liquidity and minimal debt maturities, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR expected to return to the 2x range in 2021, assuming revenue of $5.4 billion, or 15% below 2019 levels and EBITDA of approximately $300 million versus approximately $400 million in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nordstrom (BBB-/Negative): Nordstrom's ratings reflect its historically good market position in the apparel, footwear, and accessories space, with its differentiated merchandise and high level of customer service enabling the company to enjoy strong customer loyalty. However, the Negative Rating Outlook reflects concerns that recent pre-pandemic operating challenges could suggest some combination of execution shortfalls and increased susceptibility to secular headwinds in the department store space, which could limit the company's ability to return revenue and profitability close to pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to return to 4x in 2021, assuming retail sales of around $13 billion or 14% below 2019 levels and EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion versus approximately $1.5 billion in 2019. Nordstrom's ability to sustain its 'BBB-' rating would depend on the operating rebound potential through 2022, with increased confidence in Nordstrom's ability to achieve Fitch's projections and bring adjusted leverage to under 3.5x through both EBITDA expansion and debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2021 net sales could increase 14% to $19.7 billion from depressed 2020 levels, although remain below the $24.5 billion levels (or $23.2 billion proforma for the 125 store closings through 2022) seen in 2019 due to the lingering softness in apparel and a slow recovery in customer traffic. Sales growth could increase 3% in 2022 as demand continues to rebound, partially offset by sales loss from ongoing store closures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which declined to minimal amounts in 2020 from approximately USD2.2 billion in 2019, could improve toward USD1.3 billion in 2021 on sales recovery and gross margin benefit from the mix shift back to higher-margin categories such as apparel. EBITDA margins could rebound to around 6% in 2021, still below 2019 levels of 9%. EBITDA is expected to trend toward $1.5 billion beginning in 2022, with margins in the 7%-8% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is expected to be negative $600 million to negative $700 million in 2021, largely due to the reversal of the significant working capital benefit in 2020 as inventory levels rebound from significantly reduced levels in 2020 and increased capex of $650 million as the company resumes a number of growth initiatives. FCF could be $200 million to $300 million in 2022 as EBITDA improves;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR could be in the mid 4x in 2021 and the low 4x in 2022 on EBITDA recovery. This compares with 2.9x in 2019. Fitch assumes the company repays the $294 million of debt maturing in January 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A stabilization case would require <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to meet Fitch's revised projections that include EBITDA increasing to $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2022, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) declining to the mid 4x in 2021 and the low 4x in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade could occur from sustained low single digit positive comps, EBITDA approaching $1.8 billion with EBITDA margins in the high single digits, combined with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained below 4x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A negative rating action could result from a weaker than expected recovery due to ongoing secular headwinds and reduced confidence In <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to return to top line and profitability growth in 2022, such that adjusted debt/EBITDAR is sustained above 4.5x</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2020 with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no borrowings under its $2.941 billion secured ABL facility (with availability subject to a borrowing base net of letters of credit). The company put in place a $2.941 billion ABL facility and a $300 million short-term bridge revolving facility (matured in December 2020) in June 2020, that replaced the existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility with the same maturity of May 9, 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> also issued $1.3 billion of senior secured notes in June 2020 collateralized by certain real estate assets. Of the total real estate and inventory assets <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> previously held at MRH and subsidiaries, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> transferred some to new SPVs to be the security for the ABL and the new secured notes. The company's liens are limited to 15% of consolidated net tangible assets, which caps the liens to $1 billion to $1.3 billion, based on Fitch's calculation. The ABL and notes are issued outside of MRH, so the limitation on liens does not apply to this transaction. The CNTA basket could be applied to any future secured debt based on the assets remaining at MRH and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $2.941 billion ABL facility at the newly created SPV, <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, has a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the ABL facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of NOLV of inventory minus customary reserves. Prior to April 30, 2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> must maintain excess availability of 10% and after April 30, 2021, borrowings are subject to a minimum springing fixed charge coverage of 1x if availability is less than 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.3 billion senior secured notes issued by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. are secured on a first-priority basis by a pledge from PropCo (as defined below) and a first mortgage/deed of trust in all real property owned or to be owned by PropCo. The notes are also guaranteed on an unsecured basis by MRH. The notes have first lien priority on select real estate assets, based on a 2:1 loan value on a valuation (based on lit value) conducted by Eastdil. The real estate collateral for the secured notes were transferred to a newly created Propco. It includes three flagship stores (Union Square, San Francisco; Brooklyn, New York; and State Street, Chicago), 35 full-line mall locations (33 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and two Bloomingdales) in 'A' rated malls, and 10 distribution centers. The $365 million in new notes issued by MRH in July 2020 are secured by a second-priority lien on the same collateral securing the $1.3 billion senior secured notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> owns a considerable amount of real estate, including 389 (298 owned and 91 ground leased) of its 508 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores and 21 (14 owned and seven ground leased) of its 35 Bloomingdales full line stores. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> still has 375 unencumbered full line stores (owned and ground leased) and five distribution centers, which are at MRH and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In March 2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> issued $500 million of new unsecured notes due 2029, the proceeds of which were used to tender approximately $500 million of debt maturing between 2022 and 2025. The company now has $294 million of debt maturing in 2022, $665 million in 2023, and $468 million in 2024. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to deploy excess cash toward debt paydown, largely its upcoming unsecured notes maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >To preserve liquidity, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> suspended its dividend ($1.51 per share, or approximately $470 million annually) beginning the second quarter of 2020. The company also reduced inventory receipts and significantly pulled back on capex to $450 million in 2020 from its initially targeted $1 billion. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is targeting approximately $650 million in capex in 2021 and Fitch assumes capex increases from this level in 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not employ a waterfall recovery analysis for issuers assigned ratings in the 'BB' rating category. The further up the speculative-grade continuum a rating moves, the more compressed the notching between the specific classes of issuances becomes. The $2.941 billion secured ABL facility is rated 'BBB-'/'RR1', indicating outstanding recovery prospects (91%-100%). The $1.3 billion senior secured notes are rated 'BB+'/'RR2', indicating superior recovery prospects (71%-90%) and the $360 million second lien secured notes due 2024 to 2034 and the unsecured notes are rated 'BB'/'RR4', indicating average (31%-50%) recovery prospects. All non-first lien debt is capped at 'RR4' for generic ratings under Fitch's revised corporate recovery ratings and instrument ratings criteria.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-02 March 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>., <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC. (MRH) and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC at 'BB'. Fitch has also affirmed the ratings of the existing debt under <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>., MRH, and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Fitch is assigning a rating of 'BB'/'RR4' to <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings</span>' proposed eight-year $500 million senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from the new notes will be used to tender an equivalent amount of existing senior unsecured notes due 2022 to 2025, thereby extending the company's debt maturity profile and reducing near-term maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect the significant business interruption resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and changes in consumer behavior, which have materially reduced sales of apparel and accessories, while the Negative Outlook reflects uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of a recovery in operating momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch calculated EBITDA declined to $35 million in 2020 from approximately $2.2 billion in 2019 on a nearly 30% retail sales decline to $17.3 billion. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain its 'BB' rating would depend on the operating rebound potential through 2022. Adjusted leverage is expected to be in the mid-4x range in 2021, assuming revenue of $19.7 billion, a 20% decline from 2019 levels, and EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion. Leverage could return to the low 4x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery, EBITDA close to $1.5 billion and further debt paydown, with $450 million of debt maturing in January 2022. Increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to achieve Fitch's projections and bring adjusted leverage to the low 4x would lead to a stabilization in Fitch's Rating Outlook. A weaker than expected recovery due to ongoing secular headwinds which leads to leverage being sustained above 4.5x could lead to negative rating actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2020 (year ending Jan. 30, 2021) with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no borrowings under its $2.941 billion secured ABL facility (with availability subject to a borrowing base net of letters of credit). The company paid down approximately $530 million of debt that matured in January 2021 with cash on hand. The company has $450 million in senior unsecured notes maturing in January 2022, followed by $850 million in senior unsecured notes maturing in 2023 and $540 million maturing in 2024, a portion of which will be refinanced with the $500 million proposed note offering. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to repay the remaining balance of the unsecured notes due January 2022 post the proposed bond transaction with cash on hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sales Disruption from the Coronavirus Pandemic: The pandemic has severely affected revenue trajectories in categories like apparel, which have suffered from mandated or proactive store closures, weak traffic at retailers of apparel and accessories, and reduced wardrobe replenishment needs from declines in social gatherings and increased incidence of remote work arrangements. Numerous unknowns remain, including the pace of vaccine deployment, economic conditions exiting the pandemic including lingering unemployment and household income trends, the impact of potential additional government spending support, and the lasting effects the crisis will on have on long-term consumer behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> exposure to the weak apparel and accessories category has been partially mitigated by good performance in its home categories, which have benefitted from increased shelter-in-place activity. Beauty trends have been somewhat mixed, with weak trends in cosmetics offsetting better trends in other segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Relative to other U.S.-based sellers of apparel, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> significant exposure to mall locations, tourist markets and densely populated areas has resulted in more pronounced sales declines. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> sales declined 45% in the first quarter of 2020, improving to declines of 35%, 23% and 19% in its second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, as a prolonged holiday gifting season, sharpened digital and assortment focus, and stimulus support moderated declines seen in the first half. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2020 net sales declined 30% to $17.3 billion, with minimal EBITDA generation as sales deleveraging, significant inventory markdowns in 1H20, and increased delivery expenses from the shift to digital weighed heavily on margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects significant growth in 2021 against a weak 2020, with net sales and EBITDA projected around $19.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Despite the projected expansion, these sales and EBITDA estimates would still represent around 20% and 40% declines from <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> pre-pandemic 2019 figures, given lingering challenges in the apparel sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sales growth in 2022 could trend in the low-single digit range, with EBITDA approaching $1.5 billion. Achievement of these results along with debt paydown of the January 2022 maturity would result in adjusted leverage trending toward the low 4x range. Increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to achieve Fitch's projections as 2021 unfolds would lead to a stabilization in the Rating Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Actions Taken by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> suspended its dividend ($1.51 per share or approximately $470 million annually) beginning the second quarter of 2020. The company announced an incremental $630 million of annual savings from restructuring and cost cutting, on top of the $1.5 billion announced as part of its restructuring plan in February 2020, reduced inventory receipts, and significantly pulled back on capex to $450 million in 2020 from its initially targeted $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In June 2020, the company put in place a $2.941 billion secured ABL facility maturing May 9, 2024 and a $300 million short-term bridge revolving credit facility that matured in December 2020 secured by inventory, which replaced its existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility. The company also issued $1.3 billion of senior secured notes collateralized by certain real estate assets (see Liquidity section for further details).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's base case projections assume <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> capex increases to the $650 million range beginning 2021 and that the company does not restart dividend payments over the next two to three years. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to deploy excess cash toward debt paydown, largely its upcoming unsecured notes maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Business Model Evolution: While most U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers are battling competitive incursion from online and value-oriented players, sales weakness has been most pronounced for mid-tier apparel and accessories retailers. While leading players such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and Nordstrom have been able to largely offset decline in in-store sales through the growth in their e-commerce businesses pre pandemic, retailers had to invest heavily in omnichannel platforms, which have driven down EBITDA margins and reduced cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Successful retailers in the space are investing in the omnichannel model, rightsizing their store footprint, and have a differentiated product and service offering, including a well-developed value message, to draw customers in. Financially and operationally stronger department stores should be able to at least maintain their share of the apparel and accessories space over the longer term. These companies are expected to benefit from store closings and restructuring activity from cash-constrained specialty apparel players and department stores which accelerated in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has proactively rationalized its store footprint and reduced its cost structure, using the expense savings and proceeds from real estate monetization to invest in its digital business, store-related growth strategies, its relaunched loyalty program, and expansion of Bluemercury and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> Backstage. The company also benefits from relationships with key national brand vendors, especially given more acute challenges elsewhere in the department store sector. Longer term, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to stabilize its share of the mid-tier apparel, accessories and home space will depend on execution against its omnichannel and other growth initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Intensified Strategy Highlights Secular Challenges: In light of ongoing issues and lackluster 2019 performance, management announced a three-year plan in February 2020, which accelerates its strategy of real estate rationalization, cost structure optimization and targeted business re-investment. Major elements of the plan include the closure of 125 (or around 20%) of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> lower-volume stores, primarily in secondary or tertiary markets, to focus management attention on its best performing assets. Post closures, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores will decline to about 450 units from about 580 stores at the end of 3Q19 and will account for 93% of store revenue and 88% of stores going forward, with close to 85% of the locations located in A and B rated malls. Overall, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> branded stores account for 88% of total company revenue with the remaining 12% coming from Bloomingdales and Bluemercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These stores slated for closure produced approximately $1.3 billion of revenue in 2019 (less than 10% of 2019 total), and Fitch assumes minimal EBITDA. While <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> had originally targeted $700 million in asset sale proceeds from these store closures, dislocation in discretionary retail sales could adversely affect realized proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects the 125 store closures and accelerated closures by other anchor tenants such as <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 15, 2020 (and emerged in December 2020 with plans to reduce its footprint to just over 600 stores from 846 stores at the end of 2019), and store closings at retailers such as Nordstrom (which announced 16 full line store closings) could have major repercussions for the affected malls, particularly if reduced traffic and co-tenancy clauses combine to trigger further tenant departures. This would lead to the accelerated reshaping of the mall landscape, which Fitch has anticipated given the ongoing channel shifts to online and off-mall discount formats. Over time, industry leaders, both in the mall and off-mall channel, that continue to invest in omnichannel capabilities could benefit, as unproductive apparel and accessories stores and malls in the U.S. are rightsized. Benefits of reduced square footage include both protection of market share and gross margins, given the need to execute unplanned promotions in apparel and accessories environments with excess inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has experimented with new and off-mall formats. The company had planned to expand its portfolio of standalone off-price Backstage stores and test a new department store concept called Market by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, both in off-mall locations in 2020. Some of these plans were put on hold in 2020 given the liquidity and operational focus on managing through the coronavirus pandemic and a reduction in consumer discretionary spending. The company expects to test some of the off-mall concepts including adding additional off-price locations in three markets, Dallas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As part of its February 2020 analyst day, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> shared its target of $1.5 billion in reductions to its cost structure. The company has also targeted major savings in areas like supply chain optimization, store expense reduction and marketing expense efficiency. Gross margin opportunities totaled $600 million, while SG&A opportunities provided the remaining $900 million. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> commented that it had exited 2020 achieving the targeted SG&A reductions with some gross margin benefits from efforts to improve merchandise mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.5 billion in cost reductions is designed to provide <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> with reinvestment opportunity that have been additional sources of liquidity in the near term. Major areas of focus include <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> digital business, strengthening customer relationships, in-store enhancements, and private label expansion. The company is targeting site upgrades, improving its mobile app, expanding omnichannel attributes such as in-store or curbside pickup of online orders, and potential new features like recommerce and customizable fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> e-commerce business was around $6 billion or 25% of sales in 2019, and grew to $7.7 billion in 2020 or nearly 45% of sales given the significant shift to online as a result of temporary store closures and a reduction in traffic due to the pandemic. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> currently expects digital sales to be $7 billion or 35% of 2021 forecasted sales but expects the business to grow to $10 billion by 2023 and account for over 40% of its total business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch acknowledges <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> proactive approach to real estate portfolio rationalization and efforts to invest in defending share, the heightened retrenchment of the store base and cost cutting required to stabilize operations is evidence of the dislocation in the business and ongoing secular pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Declines Pre-Pandemic: EBITDA in 2019 declined 13% to $2.2 billion given a 0.8% comparable store sales decline and margin declining to 8.6% from 9.8% in 2018. Prior to the recent disruption, Fitch had expected merchandise revenue to decline below $23 billion by 2022 from a 2019 base of $24.5 billion on modest comp declines and store closures, and for EBITDA to decline under $2.0 billion despite cost reduction efforts. Fitch now expects revenue to be $21 billion to $22 billion in 2022/2023 with EBITDA trending toward the mid-$1 billion range on EBITDA margins in the 7%-8% range given a gradual recovery in apparel and accessories sales entering 2022. The company is targeting low single digit comp growth, with double digit growth in digital sales offset by low to mid digit declines in store level sales and EBITDA margin moving into the high single digits (compared with 10% in 2018).</p>

                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> financial discipline and adherence to its publicly stated financial policy (leverage of 2.5x to 2.8x, or 2.4x to 2.7x on a Fitch-calculated basis) has supported the company's credit profile over the past few years. The company is targeting leverage to return under 3x, but Fitch expects it could be well outside of this range over the next couple of years given an anticipated slow recovery in apparel and accessories sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> (BB/Negative): <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings reflect the significant business interruption resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and changes in consumer behavior, which have materially reduced sales of apparel and accessories, while the Negative Outlook reflects uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of a recovery in operating momentum. Adjusted leverage is expected to be in the mid-4x range in 2021, assuming revenue of $19.7 billion a, 20% decline from 2019 levels, and EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion. Leverage could return to the low 4x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery and EBITDA close to $1.5 billion and further debt paydown, with $450 million of debt maturing in January 2022. Increased confidence in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to achieve Fitch's projections would lead to a stabilization in the Rating Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings continue to reflect its position as the largest department store chain in the U.S. and Fitch's view of a prolonged timeframe for the company's operating trajectory to stabilize on a lower EBITDA base, given weak mall traffic and heightened competition from alternate channels that include online and off-price. This follows sustained low single digit comparable store sales declines, recent EBITDA margin contraction with increased management urgency to address secular challenges, as evidenced by the announcement of 125 store closures and $1.5 billion in cost reductions to support business reinvestment, prior to the recent downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> (BBB-/Negative): <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> ratings reflect its position as the second largest department store in the U.S. and Fitch's expectation that the company should be able to able to accelerate market share gains post the pandemic related downturn. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall real estate footprint provides some insulation from mall traffic challenges. Adjusted leverage is expected to be high-3x in 2021, assuming revenue of $17.5 billion (15% lower than 2019 levels) and EBITDA of around $1.3 billion (30% lower than 2019 levels). Leverage could decline to under 3.5x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline and EBITDA recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's (BB/Negative): Dillard's ratings reflect the company's below-industry-average sales productivity (as measured by sales psf), operating profitability and geographical concentration relative to its larger department store peers, such as <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>. The ratings consider Dillard's strong liquidity and minimal debt maturities, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR expected to return to the 2x range in 2021, assuming revenue of $5.4 billion or 15% below 2019 levels and EBITDA of approximately $300 million versus approximately $400 million in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2021 net sales could increase 14% to $19.7 billion from depressed 2020 levels, although remain below the $24.5 billion levels (or $23.2 billion proforma for the 125 store closings through 2022) seen in 2019 due to the lingering softness in apparel and a slow recovery in customer traffic. Sales growth could increase 3% in 2022 as demand continues to rebound, partially offset by sales loss from ongoing store closures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA, which declined to minimal amounts in 2020 from approximately USD2.2 billion in 2019, could improve toward USD1.3 billion in 2021 on sales recovery and gross margin benefit from the mix shift back to higher-margin categories such as apparel. EBITDA margins could rebound to around 6% in 2021, still below 2019 levels of 9%. EBITDA is expected to trend toward $1.5 billion beginning in 2022, with margins in the 7%-8% range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is expected to be negative $600 million to negative $700 million in 2021, largely due the reversal of the significant working capital benefit in 2020 as inventory levels rebound from significantly reduced levels in 2020 and increased capex of $650 million as the company resumes a number of growth initiatives. FCF could be $200 million to $300 million in 2022 as EBITDA improves;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR could be in the mid 4x in 2021 and the low 4x in 2022 on EBITDA recovery. This compares with 2.9x in 2019. Fitch assumes the company repays the remaining balance (post the proposed refinancing transaction) of the $450 million of debt maturing in January 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A stabilization case would require <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to meet Fitch's revised projections that include EBITDA increasing to $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2022, and adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) declining to the mid 4x in 2021 and the low 4x in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade could occur from sustained low single digit positive comps, EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits with EBITDA margins in the high single digits beginning 2022, combined with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained below 4x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A negative rating action could result from a weaker than expected recovery due to ongoing secular headwinds and reduced confidence In <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to return to top line and profitability growth in 2022, such that adjusted debt/EBITDAR is sustained above 4.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2020 with a cash balance of $1.7 billion and no borrowings under its $2.941 billion secured ABL facility (with availability subject to a borrowing base net of letters of credit). The company put in place a $2.941 billion ABL facility and a $300 million short-term bridge revolving facility (matured in December 2020) in June 2020, that replaced the existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility with the same maturity of May 9, 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> also issued $1.3 billion of senior secured notes in June 2020 collateralized by certain real estate assets. Of the total real estate and inventory assets <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> previously held at MRH and subsidiaries, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> transferred some to new SPVs to be the security for the ABL and the new secured notes. The company's liens are limited to 15% of consolidated net tangible assets, which caps the liens to $1 billion to $1.3 billion, based on Fitch's calculation. The ABL and notes are issued outside of MRH, so the limitation on liens does not apply to this transaction. The CNTA basket could be applied to any future secured debt based on the assets remaining at MRH and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $2.941 billion ABL facility at the newly created SPV, <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, has a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the ABL facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 90% of NOLV of inventory minus customary reserves. Prior to April 30, 2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> must maintain excess availability of 10% and after April 30, 2021, borrowings are subject to a minimum springing fixed charge coverage of 1x if availability is less than 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.3 billion senior secured notes issued by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. are secured on a first-priority basis by a pledge from PropCo (as defined below) and a first mortgage/deed of trust in all real property owned or to be owned by PropCo. The notes are also guaranteed on an unsecured basis by MRH. The notes have first lien priority on select real estate assets, based on a 2:1 loan value on a valuation (based on lit value) conducted by Eastdil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The real estate collateral for the secured notes were transferred to a newly created Propco. It includes three flagship stores (Union Square, San Francisco; Brooklyn, New York; and State Street, Chicago), 35 full-line mall locations (33 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and two Bloomingdales) in 'A' rated malls, and 10 distribution centers. The $365 million in new notes issued by MRH in July 2020 are secured by a second-priority lien on the same collateral securing the $1.3 billion senior secured notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> owns a considerable amount of real estate, including 389 (298 owned and 91 ground leased) of its 508 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores and 21 (14 owned and seven ground leased) of its 35 Bloomingdales full line stores. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> still has 375 unencumbered full line stores (owned and ground leased) and five distribution centers, which are at MRH and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Proposed Refinancing Transaction: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has proposed a refinancing in which $500 million of new unsecured notes due 2029 would be used to tender up to $500 million of debt maturing between 2022 and 2025. The company has $450 million of debt maturing in 2022, $850 million in 2023 and $540 million in 2024, with a small $24 million maturity in 2025. Fitch expects the remaining balances on the January 2022 maturity post the proposed bond transaction to be paid down with cash on hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not employ a waterfall recovery analysis for issuers assigned ratings in the 'BB' category. The further up the speculative-grade continuum a rating moves, the more compressed the notching between the specific classes of issuances becomes. The $2.941 billion secured ABL facility is rated 'BBB-'/'RR1' and the $1.3 billion senior secured notes are rated 'BB+'/'RR1', indicating outstanding recovery prospects (91%-100%). The $360 million second lien secured notes due 2024 to 2034 are rated 'BB'/'RR3', indicating above average (51%-70%) recovery prospects and the unsecured notes are rated 'BB'/'RR4', indicating average (31%-50%) recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating lease expense capitalized by 8x for historical and projected adjusted debt.</p>

The notes will be secured on a second-priority basis by (i) a pledge from <b>Macy's</b> PropCo Holdings, LLC (PropCo), an Ohio limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b>, Inc</span>., and (ii) a first mortgage/deed of trust in all real property owned or to be owned by PropCo. The notes will also be guaranteed on an unsecured basis by MRH.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> existing ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB' and the ratings on its existing debt at <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>., <b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, LLC, and <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC. The Rating Outlook is Negative. The ratings and Negative Outlook reflect the significant business interruption from the coronavirus pandemic and the implications of a downturn in discretionary spending that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects could extend well into 2021, as well as increased leverage from the recent $1.3 billion secured bond offering in June 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to over 15x in 2020 from 2.9x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to under $200 million from $2.2 billion on a sales decline of nearly 30% to $17.6 billion. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> recognizes that spring 2020 markdowns and heightened promotional activity in 2020 could yield downside to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 2020 EBITDA projections; in this case, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain its 'BB' rating would depend on the operating rebound potential through 2022. Adjusted leverage is expected to be in the mid-4x range in 2021, assuming revenue declines of over 15% and EBITDA declines of approximately 40% from 2019 levels. Leverage could return to under 4x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery. A more protracted or severe downturn or further rounds of store closures due to coronavirus concerns could lead to additional rating actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Should <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s projections come to fruition, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has sufficient liquidity to manage operations through this downturn. The company ended 2019 with $685 million of cash. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> replaced its $1.5 billion unsecured revolver with a $2.851 billion ABL facility and a $300 million short-term bridge revolving credit facility secured by a vast majority of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> owned inventory and will support significant near-term liquidity needs in 2020 and 2021. The new $1.3 billion secured notes backed by certain real estate assets also provide additional liquidity, although the new permanent debt increases <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> leverage profile longer-term. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects it could pay down with cash on hand or <span class="companylink">ABL</span> borrowings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the impact on revenues to the global consumer discretionary sector from the coronavirus pandemic to be unprecedented as mandated or proactive temporary closures of retail stores in "non-essential" categories have severely depressed sales. Numerous unknowns remain, including the length of the current outbreak and potential future waves; economic conditions exiting the pandemic including unemployment and household income trends, the impact of government support of business and consumers; and the impact the crisis will have on consumer behavior. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes the pandemic will yield a consumer spending recession that lasts through much of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates significant growth in 2021 against a weak 2020 but expects total 2021 discretionary sales could remain 8%-10% below 2019 levels. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has forecasted that department store sales, which have been on a secular decline, will fare worse with 2021 sales projected to decline in the low to mid-teens. Given the typical timing of a consumer downturn (four to six quarters), revenue trends could accelerate somewhat exiting 2021, with 2022 projected as a modest growth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Assuming this scenario, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue to decline nearly 30% in 2020 with EBITDA declining to under $200 million from $2.2 billion in 2019. EBITDA is expected to be materially negative in first half 2020 given extended store closures and significant markdowns required to clear spring inventory. In 2021, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects revenue to decline over 15% and EBITDA to decline approximately 40% from 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> closed its stores nationwide on March 18, 2020. As the company continues to monitor the situation case by case, management developed a staggered store reopening plan with most stores open by end of June and with sequencing driven by a location's current external conditions and regulations as well as its expected profitability and cash flow generation upon reopening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Actions Taken by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>: On March 19, 2020, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> drew down on its entire $1.5 billion credit facility due to expire in May 2024 and suspended its dividend ($1.51 per share or approximately $470 million annually) beginning the second quarter of 2020. The company announced an incremental $630 million of annual savings from restructuring and cost cutting, on top of the $1.5 billion announced as part of its restructuring plan in February 2020, reduce inventory receipts especially as it goes into the important holiday season and significantly pull back on capital expenditures. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has reduced its 2020 capex to approximately $450 million from its initially targeted $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company put in place a $2.851 billion ABL facility and a $300 million short-term bridge revolving credit facility secured by inventory, which will replace the existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility with the same maturity of May 9, 2024 and $1.3 billion senior secured notes collateralized by certain real estate assets (see Liquidity section for further details).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Business Model Evolution: While most U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers are battling competitive incursion from online and value-oriented players, sales weakness is most pronounced for mid-tier apparel and accessories retailers. While leading players such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> have been able to largely offset decline in in-store sales through the growth in their e-commerce businesses, retailers are forced to invest heavily in omni-channel platforms, which have driven down EBITDA margins and reduced cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Successful retailers in the space are investing in the omni-channel model, rightsizing their store footprint, and have a differentiated product and service offering, including a well-developed value message, to draw customers in. Financially and operationally stronger department stores should be able to at least maintain their share of the apparel and accessories space over the longer term. These companies are expected to benefit from store closings and restructuring activity from cash-constrained specialty apparel players and department stores, which could further accelerate in a downturn environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Longer-term, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> as well positioned to gain share in the mid-tier department store space as it continues to invest in its omni-channel and other growth initiatives. In recent years, the company has proactively rationalized its store footprint and reduced its cost structure, using the expense savings and proceeds from real estate monetization to invest in its digital business, store-related growth strategies, its relaunched loyalty program, and expansion of <span class="companylink">Bluemercury</span> and <b>Macy's</b> Backstage. The company also benefits from relationships with key national brand vendors, especially given more acute challenges elsewhere in the department store sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Intensified Strategy Highlights Secular Challenges: In light of ongoing issues and lackluster 2019 performance, management announced a three-year plan, which accelerates its recent strategy of real estate rationalization, cost structure optimization and targeted business re-investment. Major elements of the plan include the closure of 125 (or around 20%) of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> lower-volume stores, primarily in secondary or tertiary markets, to focus management attention on its best performing assets. These stores produced approximately $1.4 billion of revenue (less than 10% of 2019 total), and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes minimal EBITDA, and real estate sales are expected to be a continued source of debt reduction over the medium term. While <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has targeted $700 million in asset sale proceeds over the next three years, dislocation in discretionary retail sales could have an adverse impact in the near term, and so <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has assumed minimal asset sale proceeds in its projections through 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the 125 store closures and accelerated closures by other anchor tenants such as <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 15, 2020, and <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> (which announced 16 full line store closings) could have major repercussions for the affected malls, particularly if reduced traffic and co-tenancy clauses combine to trigger further tenant departures. This would lead to the accelerated reshaping of the mall landscape, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has anticipated given the ongoing channel shifts to online and off-mall discount formats. Over time, industry leaders, both in the mall and off-mall channel, that continue to invest in omni-channel capabilities could benefit, as unproductive apparel and accessories stores and malls in the U.S. are rightsized. Benefits of reduced square footage include both protection of market share and gross margins, given the need to execute unplanned promotions in apparel and accessories environments with excess inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has experimented with new and off-mall formats. The company had planned to expand its portfolio of standalone off-price Backstage stores and test a new department store concept called Market by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, both in off-mall locations in 2020. Some of these plans have likely been put on hold given the immediate liquidity needs to manage through the coronavirus pandemic and a reduction in consumer discretionary spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As part of its February analyst day, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> shared its target of $1.5 billion in reductions to its cost structure. The company has also targeted major savings in areas like supply chain optimization, store expense reduction and marketing expense efficiency. Gross margin opportunities total $600 million, while SG&A opportunities provide the remaining $900 million. The company also announced New York City will become the company's sole corporate headquarters in a sweep of campus consolidation and headcount reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.5 billion in cost reductions is designed to provide <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> with reinvestment opportunity that could be additional sources of liquidity in the near term. Major areas of focus include <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> digital business, strengthening customer relationships, in-store enhancements, and private label expansion. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> e-commerce business was around $6 billion or 25% of sales in 2019, and the company is targeting continued growth through site upgrades, improving its mobile app, expanding omni-channel attributes such as in-store or curbside pickup of online orders, and potential new features like recommerce and customizable fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> acknowledges <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> proactive approach to real estate portfolio rationalization and efforts to invest in defending share, the heightened retrenchment of the store base and cost cutting required to stabilize operations is evidence of the dislocation in the business and ongoing secular pressure. In addition, a number of these initiatives could be put on hold to preserve liquidity given the current situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Maintains Downward Trajectory: EBITDA in 2019 declined 13% to $2.2 billion given a 0.8% comparable store sales decline and margin declining to 8.6% from 9.8% in 2018. Prior to the recent disruption, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> had expected merchandise revenue to decline below $23 billion over the next two to three years on modest comp declines and store closures, and for EBITDA to decline under $2.0 billion over the next three years despite cost reduction efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has paid down over $3 billion in debt over the past four years since 2016, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR ending at 2.9x in 2019. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> financial discipline and adherence to its publicly stated financial policy (leverage of 2.5x to 2.8x, or 2.4x to 2.7x on a Fitch-calculated basis) supported the company's credit profile in the face of operational challenges, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects it could be outside of this range beyond 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recent rating downgrades and Outlook revisions for U.S. department stores reflect the significant business interruption from the coronavirus and the implications of a downturn in discretionary spending that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects could extend well into 2021. Ratings actions have also resulted from decisions to add permanent debt to balance sheets to support liquidity. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span>, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and Dillard's are expected to have sufficient liquidity to manage operations through this downturn, should <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s projections come to fruition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Macy's</b> U.S. department store peers include <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and <span class="companylink">Dillard's, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> (BB/Negative): <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to over 15x in 2020 from 2.9x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to around $200 million from $2.2 billion on a sales decline of nearly 30% to $17.6 billion. Spring 2020 markdowns and heightened promotional activity in 2020 could yield downside to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 2020 EBITDA projections; in this case, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain its 'BB' rating would depend on the operating rebound potential through 2022. Leverage could return to under 4x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings continue to reflect its position as the largest department store chain in the U.S. and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of a prolonged timeframe for the company's operating trajectory to stabilize on a lower EBITDA base, given weak mall traffic and heightened competition from alternate channels that include online and off-price. This follows sustained low single digit comparable store sales declines, recent EBITDA margins well below expectations and increased management urgency to address secular challenges, as evidenced by the announcement of 125 store closures and $1.5 billion in cost reductions to support business reinvestment, prior to the recent downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> (BBB-/Negative): <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to 8x in 2020 from 2.3x in 2019. This reflects EBITDA declining to approximately $0.5 billion from $2 billion on a sales decline of 20% to just under $16 billion, the full drawdown on its $1.5 billion credit facility and recent $600 million bond issuance. Adjusted leverage is expected to be high-3x in 2021, assuming revenue declines of around 15% and EBITDA declines of around 40% in 2021 from 2019 levels and paydown of <span class="companylink">ABL</span> borrowings. Leverage could decline to under 3.5x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> ratings reflect its position as the second largest department store in the U.S. and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that the company should be able to able to accelerate market share gains post the discretionary downturn. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> continue to invest aggressively in their businesses while maintaining healthy cash flow. These retailers have well developed omni-channel strategies, with online sales contributing close to 25% of total revenue (over 30% at <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span>), which should benefit their top-line as retail sales continue to move online. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall real estate footprint provides some insulation from mall traffic challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's (BB/Negative): <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates a sharp decline in EBITDA to under $50 million in 2020 from $392 million in 2019 on a revenue decline of over 20% to $5 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to be over 2x in 2021, assuming sales declines in the low-teens and EBITDA of approximately $300 million or around 30% lower compared to 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's ratings reflect the company's below-industry-average sales productivity (as measured by sales psf), operating profitability and geographical concentration relative to its larger department store peers, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, <span class="companylink">Nordstrom</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>. The ratings consider Dillard's strong liquidity and minimal debt maturities, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR expected to return to the 2x range in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Below are <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s projections reflecting the significant business interruption from COVID-19 and the ramifications for a likely downturn in discretionary spending extending well into 2021:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2020 sales could decline nearly 30% to $17.6 billion and EBITDA could decline to under $200 million from $2.2 billion, assuming store closures through mid-May and a slow recovery in customer traffic for the remainder of the year. While 2021 revenue and EBITDA should significantly rebound from depressed 2020 levels, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects 2021 sales of approximately $20 billion and EBITDA of around $1.3 billion to be over 15% and approximately 40%, respectively, lower than 2019 levels given <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectations of a likely downturn in discretionary spending that could extend well into late 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Beginning 2022, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could resume low-single digit topline and EBITDA growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is expected to be approximately negative $1 billion in 2020, largely due to a $2 billion reduction in EBITDA, somewhat mitigated by lower cash taxes, significantly reduced capex and potential working capital benefit. FCF in 2021 could approach positive $400 million as EBITDA improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which was 2.9x in 2019, could climb to over 15x in 2020 and decline to the 5.0x range in 2021 on EBITDA swings. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects it could pay down with a drawdown on its <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A stabilization case would require <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to meet <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s revised projections that include EBITDA increasing to $1.3 billion in 2021 and adjusted debt/EBITDAR moderating to the mid 4x in 2021 and below 4x in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade could occur from sustained low single digit positive comps, EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits with EBITDA margins in the high single digits beginning 2022, combined with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained below 3.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A negative rating action could result on a more protracted or severe downturn and reduced confidence In <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to return to top line and profitability growth in 2022 such that adjusted debt/EBITDAR is sustained above 4x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2019 with a cash balance of $685 million. On March 20, 2020, the company announced it had fully borrowed on its $1.5 billion revolver to enhance liquidity. Additionally, it announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend beginning the second quarter of 2020. As of May 2, 2020, the company had $1.5 billion in cash on hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company put in place a $2.851 billion ABL facility and a $300 million short-term bridge revolving facility (maturing in December 2020) in June 2020, secured by inventory that replaced the existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility with the same maturity of May 9, 2024. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> also issued $1.3 billion of senior secured notes collateralized by certain real estate assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In June 2020, MRH commenced an offer to bondholders holding an aggregate of $466 million of outstanding senior unsecured debt (11% of total unsecured debt) to tender debt in exchange for new second lien secured notes to be issued by MRH for the validly tendered outstanding notes/debentures. The debt under this tender and exchange offer was under issued under a 1996 indenture and had restrictions around the negative pledge covenant (including restrictions on sales leaseback transactions) that could impact secured debt issuance at MRH. On July 24, 2020, the company announced the final results of the exchange offers. Of the total $466 million, $360 million or 77% was tendered and the company issued $360 million in second lien secured notes due between 2024 and 2030 in exchange for existing unsecured debt of the same amount, coupon and maturity. The remaining $105 million of old notes will have the same new covenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Of the total real estate and inventory assets <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> currently holds through MRH and subsidiaries, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> transferred some to new SPVs to be the security for the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> and the new secured notes. The company's liens are limited to 15% of consolidated net tangible assets, which caps the liens to $1 billion to $1.3 billion, based on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s calculation. The <span class="companylink">ABL</span> and notes are issued outside of MRH, so the limitation on liens does not apply to this transaction. The CNTA basket could be applied to any future secured debt based on the assets remaining at MRH and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $2.851 billion ABL facility and $300 million short-term bridge revolving loan facility at the newly created SPV, <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, have a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 80% of NOLV of inventory minus customary reserves (which would increase to 90% at the earlier of March 31, 2021 or the date on which a new appraisal and field exam is delivered. Prior to April 30, 2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> must maintain excess availability of 10% and after April 30, 2021, borrowings are subject to a minimum springing fixed charge coverage of 1x if availability is less than 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.3 billion new senior secured notes issued by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. in June 2020 are secured on a first-priority basis by a pledge from PropCo and a first mortgage/deed of trust in all real property owned or to be owned by PropCo. The notes are also guaranteed on an unsecured basis by MRH. The notes have first lien priority on select real estate assets, based on a 2:1 loan value on recent valuation (based on lit value) conducted by Eastdil. The real estate collateral for the new secured notes has been transferred to a newly created Propco. It includes three flagship stores (Union Square, San Francisco; Brooklyn, New York; and State Street, Chicago), 35 full-line mall locations (33 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and two Bloomingdales) in 'A' rated malls, and 10 distribution centers. The $365 million in new notes issued by MRH in July 2020 will be secured by a second-priority lien on the same collateral securing the $1.3 billion senior secured notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> owns a considerable amount of real estate, including 408 (312 owned and 96 ground leased) of its 544 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores and 20 (13 owned and seven ground leased) of its Bloomingdales full line stores. This amounts to 80% of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line square footage and approximately 60% of total square footage. Post this transaction, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> still has 390 unencumbered full line stores (owned and ground leased) and five distribution centers, which are at MRH and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects it could pay down with cash on hand or <span class="companylink">ABL</span> borrowings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not employ a waterfall recovery analysis for issuers assigned ratings in the 'BB' category. The further up the speculative grade continuum a rating moves, the more compressed the notching between the specific classes of issuances becomes. The $2.851 billion secured <span class="companylink">ABL</span> facility and the $300 million short-term bridge revolving credit facility are rated 'BBB-'/'RR1' and the $1.3 billion senior secured notes are rated 'BB+'/'RR1', indicating outstanding recovery prospects (91%-100%) and the unsecured notes are rated 'BB'/'RR4', indicating average (31%-50%) recovery prospects. The new $360 million second lien secured notes are rated 'BB'/'RR3', indicating above average (51%-70%) recovery prospects.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-26 May 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings Inc</span>. (MRHI) to 'BB' from 'BB+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has assigned a 'BBB-'/'RR1' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> expected $3 billion secured asset based loan (ABL) facility, including approximately $2.7 billion revolving credit facility and up to $300 million bridge facility at a newly created SPV, <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, to which Fitch is assigning an IDR of 'BB'. Fitch has also assigned a 'BB+'/'RR1' rating to new $1.1 billion senior secured first-lien notes due 2025 at <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. The notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by (i) a pledge from <b>Macy's</b> PropCo Holdings, LLC (PropCo), an Ohio limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b>, Inc</span>., and (ii) a first mortgage/deed of trust in all real property owned or to be owned by PropCo. The notes will also be guaranteed on an unsecured basis by MRHI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade and Negative Outlook reflect the significant business interruption from the coronavirus pandemic and the implications of a downturn in discretionary spending that Fitch expects could extend well into 2021, as well as increased leverage from the new secured bond offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to over 15x in 2020 from 2.9x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to around $200 million from $2.2 billion on a sales decline of nearly 30% to $17.6 billion. Fitch recognizes that spring 2020 markdowns and heightened promotional activity in 2020 could yield downside to Fitch's 2020 EBITDA projections; in this case, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain its 'BB' rating would depend on the operating rebound potential through 2022. Adjusted leverage is expected to be in the mid-4x range in 2021, assuming revenue declines of over 15% and EBITDA declines of approximately 40% from 2019 levels. Leverage could return to under 4x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery. A more protracted or severe downturn or further rounds of store closures due to coronavirus concerns could lead to additional rating actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Should Fitch's projections come to fruition, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has sufficient liquidity to manage operations through this downturn. The company ended 2019 with $685 million of cash. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is replacing its $1.5 billion unsecured revolver with an expected $3 billion ABL facility that will be secured by a vast majority owned <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and will support significant near-term liquidity needs in 2020 and 2021. The new $1.1 billion term loan backed by certain real estate assets also provides additional liquidity, although the new permanent debt increases <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> leverage profile longer-term. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which Fitch expects it could pay down with cash on hand or revolver borrowings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch withdrew the rating on <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> prior unsecured bank facility following its replacement by the new secured ABL facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic: Fitch expects the impact on revenues for the consumer discretionary sector from the coronavirus pandemic to be unprecedented as mandated or proactive temporary closures of retail stores in "non-essential" categories severely depress sales. Numerous unknowns remain including the length of the outbreak; the timeframe for a full reopening of retail locations and the cadence at which it is achieved; and economic conditions exiting the pandemic including unemployment and household income trends, the impact of government support of business and consumers, and the impact the crisis will have on consumer behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has assumed a scenario where discretionary retailers in the U.S. are essentially closed through mid-May with sales expected to be down 80%-90% despite some sales shifting online, with a slow rate of improvement expected through the summer. Given an increased likelihood of a consumer downturn, discretionary sales could decline in the mid-to-high single digits through the holiday season. Fitch anticipates significant growth in 2021 against a weak 2020 but expects total 2021 discretionary sales could remain 8%-10% below 2019 levels. Fitch has forecasted that department store sales, which have been on a secular decline, will fare worse with 2021 sales projected to decline in the low to mid-teens. Given the typical timing of a consumer downturn (four to six quarters), revenue trends could accelerate somewhat exiting 2021, with 2022 projected as a modest growth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Assuming this scenario, Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue to decline nearly 30% in 2020 with EBITDA declining to approximately $200 million from $2.2 billion in 2019. EBITDA is expected to be materially negative in first half 2020 given extended store closures and significant markdowns required to clear spring inventory. In 2021, Fitch expects revenue to decline of over 15% and EBITDA to decline approximately 40% from 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> closed its stores nationwide on March 17, 2020. As the company continues to monitor the situation case by case, management has developed a staggered store reopening plan with most stores anticipated to be open by end of June and with sequencing driven by a location's current external conditions and regulations as well as its expected profitability and cash flow generation upon reopening. Nearly 100 stores reopened in early May, with nearly 200 stores open in mid-May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Actions Taken by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>: On March 19, 2020, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> drew down on its entire $1.5 billion credit facility due to expire in May 2024 and suspended its dividend ($1.51 per share or approximately $470 million annually) beginning the second quarter of 2020. The company could look to further cut expenses beyond those announced as part of its restructuring plan in February 2020, reduce inventory receipts especially as it goes into the important holiday season and significantly pull back on capital expenditures. Fitch expects the company to materially reduce its initially targeted capex of $1 billion for 2020 by 50%-75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company expects to put in place a $3 billion ABL facility secured by inventory, which will replace the existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility with the same maturity of May 9, 2024 and $1.1 billion senior secured notes collateralized by certain real estate assets (see Liquidity section for further details).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Business Model Evolution: While most U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers are battling competitive incursion from online and value-oriented players, sales weakness is most pronounced for mid-tier apparel and accessories retailers. While leading players such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and Nordstrom have been able to largely offset decline in in-store sales through the growth in their e-commerce businesses, retailers are forced to invest heavily in omni-channel platforms, which have driven down EBITDA margins and reduced cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Successful retailers in the space are investing in the omni-channel model, rightsizing their store footprint, and have a differentiated product and service offering, including a well-developed value message, to draw customers in. Financially and operationally stronger department stores should be able to at least maintain their share of the apparel and accessories space over the longer term. These companies are expected to benefit from store closings and restructuring activity from cash-constrained specialty apparel players and department stores, which could further accelerate in a downturn environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Longer-term, Fitch views <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> as well positioned to gain share in the mid-tier department store space as it continues to invest in its omni-channel and other growth initiatives. In recent years, the company has proactively rationalized its store footprint and reduced its cost structure, using the expense savings and proceeds from real estate monetization to invest in its digital business, store-related growth strategies, its relaunched loyalty program, and expansion of Bluemercury and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> Backstage. The company also benefits from relationships with key national brand vendors, especially given more acute challenges elsewhere in the department store sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Intensified Strategy Highlights Secular Challenges: In light of ongoing issues and lackluster 2019 performance, management announced a three-year plan, which accelerates its recent strategy of real estate rationalization, cost structure optimization and targeted business re-investment. Major elements of the plan include the closure of 125 (or around 20%) of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> lower-volume stores, primarily in secondary or tertiary markets, to focus management attention on its best performing assets. These stores produce approximately $1.4 billion of revenue (less than 10% of 2019 total), and Fitch assumes minimal EBITDA, and real estate sales are expected to be a continued source of debt reduction over the medium term. While <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has targeted $700 million in asset sale proceeds over the next three years, dislocation in discretionary retail sales could have an adverse impact in the near term, and so Fitch has assumed minimal asset sale proceeds in its projections through 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects the 125 store closures and accelerated closures by other anchor tenants such as <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 15, 2020, and Nordstrom (which announced 16 full line store closings) could have major repercussions for the affected malls, particularly if reduced traffic and co-tenancy clauses combine to trigger further tenant departures. This would lead to the accelerated reshaping of the mall landscape, which Fitch has anticipated given the ongoing channel shifts to online and off-mall discount formats. Over time, industry leaders, both in the mall and off-mall channel, that continue to invest in omni-channel capabilities could benefit, as unproductive apparel and accessories stores and malls in the U.S. are rightsized. Benefits of reduced square footage include both protection of market share and gross margins, given the need to execute unplanned promotions in apparel and accessories environments with excess inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has experimented with new and off-mall formats. The company had planned to expand its portfolio of standalone off-price Backstage stores and test a new department store concept called Market by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, both in off-mall locations in 2020. Some of these plans have likely been put on hold given the immediate liquidity needs to manage through the coronavirus pandemic and a reduction in consumer discretionary spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As part of its February analyst day, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> shared its target of $1.5 billion in reductions to its cost structure. The company has also targeted major savings in areas like supply chain optimization, store expense reduction and marketing expense efficiency. Gross margin opportunities total $600 million, while SG&A opportunities provide the remaining $900 million. The company also announced New York City will become the company's sole corporate headquarters in a sweep of campus consolidation and headcount reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.5 billion in cost reductions is designed to provide <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> with around $1 billion of business reinvestment opportunity that could be additional sources of liquidity in the near term. Major areas of focus include <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> digital business, strengthening customer relationships, in-store enhancements, and private label expansion. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> e-commerce business is around $6 billion, or 25% of sales, and the company is targeting continued growth through site upgrades, improving its mobile app, expanding omni-channel attributes such as in-store pickup of online orders, and potential new features like recommerce and customizable fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch acknowledges <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> proactive approach to real estate portfolio rationalization and efforts to invest in defending share, the heightened retrenchment of the store base and cost cutting required to stabilize operations is evidence of the dislocation in the business and ongoing secular pressure. In addition, a number of these initiatives could be put on hold to preserve liquidity given the current situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Maintains Downward Trajectory: EBITDA in 2019 declined 13% to $2.2 billion given a 0.8% comparable store sales decline and margin declining to 8.6% from 9.8% in 2018. Prior to the recent disruption, Fitch had expected merchandise revenue to decline below $23 billion over the next two to three years on modest comp declines and store closures, and for EBITDA to decline under $2.0 billion over the next three years despite cost reduction efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has paid down over $3 billion in debt over the past four years since 2016, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR ending at 2.9x in 2019. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> financial discipline and adherence to its publicly stated financial policy (leverage of 2.5x to 2.8x, or 2.4x to 2.7x on a Fitch-calculated basis) supported the company's credit profile in the face of operational challenges, although Fitch expects it could be outside of this range beyond 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recent rating downgrades and Outlook revisions for U.S. department stores reflect the significant business interruption from the coronavirus and the implications of a downturn in discretionary spending that Fitch expects could extend well into 2021. Ratings actions have also resulted from decisions to add permanent debt to balance sheets to support liquidity. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, Nordstrom, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and Dillard's are expected to have sufficient liquidity to manage operations through this downturn, should Fitch's projections come to fruition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Macy's</b> U.S. department store peers include <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, and <span class="companylink">Dillard's, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> (BB/Negative): Fitch anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to over 15x in 2020 from 2.9x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to around $200 million from $2.2 billion on a sales decline of nearly 30% to $17.6 billion. Spring 2020 markdowns and heightened promotional activity in 2020 could yield downside to Fitch's 2020 EBITDA projections; in this case, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain its 'BB' rating would depend on the operating rebound potential through 2022. Leverage could return to under 4x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings continue to reflect its position as the largest department store chain in the U.S. and Fitch's view of a prolonged timeframe for the company's operating trajectory to stabilize on a lower EBITDA base, given weak mall traffic and heightened competition from alternate channels that include online and off-price. This follows sustained low single digit comparable store sales declines, recent EBITDA margins well below expectations and increased management urgency to address secular challenges, as evidenced by the announcement of 125 store closures and $1.5 billion in cost reductions to support business reinvestment, prior to the recent downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nordstrom (BBB-/Negative): Fitch anticipates a sharp increase in adjusted leverage to 7.0x in 2020 from 3.0x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to approximately $550 million from $1.6 billion on a revenue decline of over 20% to $12 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to decline to the mid-3.0x range in 2021, assuming sales declines of around 10% and EBITDA declines of about 20% in 2021 from 2019 levels. Leverage could return to under 3.5x in 2022, assuming a sustained top-line recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nordstrom's ratings reflect its position as a market share consolidator in the apparel, footwear and accessories space, with its differentiated merchandise and high level of customer service enabling the company to enjoy strong customer loyalty. The company has a well-developed product offering across a diverse portfolio of full line department stores, off-price Nordstrom Rack locations and multiple online channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> (BBB-/Negative): Fitch anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to 8x in 2020 from 2.3x in 2019. This reflects EBITDA declining to approximately $0.5 billion from $2 billion on a sales decline of 20% to just under $16 billion, the full drawdown on its $1.5 billion credit facility and recent $600 million bond issuance. Adjusted leverage is expected to be high-3x in 2021, assuming revenue declines of around 15% and EBITDA declines of around 40% in 2021 from 2019 levels and paydown of revolver borrowings. Leverage could decline to under 3.5x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> ratings reflect its position as the second largest department store in the U.S. and Fitch's expectation that the company should be able to able to accelerate market share gains post the discretionary downturn. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> continue to invest aggressively in their businesses while maintaining healthy cash flow. These retailers have well developed omnichannel strategies, with online sales contributing close to 25% of total revenue (over 30% at Nordstrom), which should benefit their top-line as retail sales continue to move online. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall real estate footprint provides some insulation from mall traffic challenges</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's (BB/Negative): Fitch anticipates a sharp decline in EBITDA to under $50 million in 2020 from $392 million in 2019 on a revenue decline of over 20% to $5 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to be over 2x in 2021, assuming sales declines in the low-teens and EBITDA of approximately $300 million or around 30% lower compared to 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's ratings reflect the company's below-industry-average sales productivity (as measured by sales psf), operating profitability and geographical concentration relative to its larger department store peers, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>. The ratings consider Dillard's strong liquidity and minimal debt maturities, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR expected to return to the 2x range in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Below are Fitch's projections prior to disruption related to coronavirus:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Top-line to decline more sharply in 2020 in the mid-single digits driven by negative low-single digit comps, given the disruption from store closings and disruptions from its restructuring initiatives. Declines moderate in 2021 and beyond with top-line contraction of 1% to 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA decline of 5% in 2020 from $2.2 billion in 2019 with continued low-to-mid single digit declines thereafter to under $2 billion in 2021, with EBITDA margins in the low 8% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF after dividends to be modestly negative in 2020 due to cash restructuring charges and modestly positive thereafter given dividends of $470 million and capex spend of $1 billion annually. This excludes a projected $700 million in net proceeds from asset sales through 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR to remain in the high 2x range, as EBITDA declines are mitigated by proactive debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Below are Fitch's revised projections reflecting the significant business interruption from COVID-19 and the ramifications for a likely downturn in discretionary spending extending well into 2021:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2020 sales could decline nearly 30% to $17.6 billion and EBITDA could decline to approximately $200 million from $2.2 billion, assuming store closures through mid-May and a slow recovery in customer traffic for the remainder of the year. While 2021 revenue and EBITDA should significantly rebound from depressed 2020 levels, Fitch expects 2021 sales of approximately $20 billion and EBITDA of around $1.3 billion to be over 15% and approximately 40%, respectively, lower than 2019 levels given Fitch's expectations of a likely downturn in discretionary spending that could extend well into late 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Beginning 2022, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could resume low-single digit topline and EBITDA growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is expected to be approximately negative $900 million in 2020, largely due to a $2 billion reduction in EBITDA, somewhat mitigated by lower cash taxes, significantly reduced capex and potential working capital benefit. FCF in 2021 could approach positive $500 million as EBITDA improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which was 2.9x in 2019, could climb to over 15x in 2020 and decline to the mid-4.0x range in 2021 on EBITDA swings. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which Fitch expects it could pay down with a drawdown on its revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A stabilization case would require <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to meet Fitch's revised projections that include EBITDA increasing to $1.3 billion in 2021 and adjusted debt/EBITDAR moderating to the mid 4x in 2021 and below 4x in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade could occur from sustained low single digit positive comps, EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits with EBITDA margins in the high single digits beginning 2022, combined with adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained below 3.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A negative rating action could result on a more protracted or severe downturn and reduced confidence In <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to return to top line and profitability growth in 2022 such that adjusted debt/EBITDAR is sustained above 4x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2019 with a cash balance of $685 million. On March 20, 2020, the company announced it had fully borrowed on its $1.5 billion revolver to enhance liquidity. Additionally, it announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend beginning the second quarter of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company expects to put in place a $3 billion ABL facility secured by inventory which will replace the existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility with the same maturity of May 9, 2024; and $1.1 billion senior secured notes collateralized by certain real estate assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Of the total real estate and inventory assets <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> currently holds through MRHI and subsidiaries, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is transferring some to new SPVs to be the security for the ABL and the new secured notes. The company's liens are limited to 15% of consolidated net tangible assets, which caps the liens to $1 billion to $1.3 billion, based on Fitch's calculation. The ABL and notes are issued outside of MRHI, so the limitation on liens does not apply to this transaction. The CNTA basket could be applied to any future secured debt based on the assets remaining at MRHI and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The expected $3 billion ABL facility at the newly created SPV, <b>Macy's</b> Inventory Funding LLC, will have a first lien priority on inventory. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a borrowing base based on 80% of NOLV of inventory minus customary reserves (which would increase to 90% at the earlier of March 31, 2021 or the date on which a new appraisal and field exam is delivered. Prior to April 30, 2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> must maintain excess availability of 10% and after April 30, 2021, borrowings are subject to a minimum springing fixed charge coverage of 1x if availability is less than 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The issuer of the $1.1 billion new senior secured notes will be <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. and the notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by a pledge from PropCo and a first mortgage/deed of trust in all real property owned or to be owned by PropCo. The notes will also be guaranteed on an unsecured basis by MRHI. The notes have first lien priority on select real estate assets, based on a 2:1 loan value on recent valuation (based on lit value) conducted by Eastdil. The real estate collateral for the new secured notes includes three flagship stores (Union Square, San Francisco; Brooklyn, New York, and State Street, Chicago), 35 full-line mall locations (33 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and two Bloomingdales) in 'A' rated malls, and 10 distribution centers, that has been transferred to a newly created Propco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> owns a considerable amount of real estate, including 408 (312 owned and 96 ground leased) of its 544 <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line stores and 20 (13 owned and seven ground leased) of its Bloomingdales full line stores. This amounts to 80% of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> full line square footage and approximately 60% of total square footage. Post this transaction, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> still has 390 unencumbered full line stores (owned and ground leased) and five distribution centers, which are at MRHI and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which Fitch expects it could pay down with cash on hand or revolver borrowings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not employ a waterfall recovery analysis for issuers assigned ratings in the 'BB' category. The further up the speculative grade continuum a rating moves, the more compressed the notching between the specific classes of issuances becomes. The expected $3 billion secured ABL facility (including up to a $300 million bridge facility) are rated 'BBB-/RR1' and the $1.1 billion senior secured notes are rated 'BB+/RR1', indicating outstanding recovery prospects (91%-100%) and the unsecured notes are rated 'BB'/'RR4', indicating average (31%-50%) recovery prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operating lease expense capitalized by 8x for historical and projected adjusted debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-01 April 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Inc</span>. to 'BB+' from 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Negative. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade and Negative Outlook reflect the significant business interruption from the coronavirus pandemic and the implications of a downturn in discretionary spending that Fitch expects could extend well into 2021. Fitch anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to over 11x in 2020 from 2.9x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to around $325 million from $2.2 billion on a revenue decline of nearly 25% to $19.2 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to be in the low 4x in 2021, assuming revenue declines of over 15% and EBITDA declines of approximately 40% from 2019 levels. Leverage could return to the low 3x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery. A more protracted or severe downturn could lead to further actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Should Fitch's projections come to fruition, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has sufficient liquidity to manage operations through this downturn. The company ended 2019 with $685 million of cash and recently drew fully on its $1.5 billion unsecured revolver. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which Fitch expects it could pay down with the recent drawdown on the revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic: Fitch expects the impact on revenues for the consumer discretionary sector from the coronavirus pandemic to be unprecedented as mandated or proactive temporary closures of retail stores in "non-essential" categories severely depresses sales. Numerous unknowns remain including the length of the outbreak; the timeframe for a full reopening of retail locations and the cadence at which it is achieved; and the economic conditions exiting the pandemic including unemployment and household income trends, the impact of government support of business and consumers, and the impact the crisis will have on consumer behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has assumed a scenario where discretionary retailers in the U.S. are essentially closed through mid-May with sales expected to be down 80%-90% despite some sales shifting online, with a slow rate of improvement expected through the summer. Given an increased likelihood of a consumer downturn, discretionary sales could decline in the mid-to-high single digits through the holiday season. Fitch anticipates significant growth in 2021 against a weak 2020, but expect total 2021discrectionary sales could remain 8%-10% below 2019 levels. Fitch has forecasted that department store sales, which have been on a secular decline, will fare worse with 2021 sales projected to decline in the low to mid-teens. Given the typical timing of a consumer downturn (four to six quarters), revenue trends could accelerate somewhat exiting 2021, with 2022 projected as a modest growth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Assuming this scenario, Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> revenue to decline nearly 25% in 2020 with EBITDA declining to approximately $325 million from $2.2 billion in 2019. In 2021, Fitch expects revenue to decline of over 15% and EBITDA to decline approximately 40% from 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Actions taken by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>: On March 19, 2020, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> drew down on its entire $1.5 billion credit facility due to expire in May 2024 and suspended its dividend ($1.51 per share or approximately $470 million annually) beginning the second quarter of 2020. The company could look to further cut expenses beyond those announced as part of its restructuring plan in February 2020, reduce inventory receipts especially as it goes into the important holiday season and significantly pull back on capital expenditures. Fitch has assumed that it could reduce its initially targeted capex of $1 billion for 2020 by half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Business Model Evolution: While most U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers are battling competitive incursion from online and value-oriented players, sales weakness is most pronounced for mid-tier apparel and accessories retailers. While leading players such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> and Nordstrom have been able to largely offset decline in in-store sales through the growth in their e-commerce businesses, retailers are forced to invest heavily in omnichannel platforms, which have driven down EBITDA margins and reduced cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Successful retailers in the space are investing in the omnichannel model, rightsizing their store footprint, and have a differentiated product and service offering, including a well-developed value message, to draw customers in. Financially and operationally stronger department stores should be able to at least maintain their share of the apparel and accessories space over the longer term. These companies are expected to benefit from store closings and restructuring activity from cash-constrained specialty apparel players and department stores, which could further accelerate in a downturn environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Longer term, Fitch views <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> as well positioned to gain share in the mid-tier department store space as it continues to invest in its omnichannel and other growth initiatives. In recent years, the company has proactively rationalized its store footprint and reduced its cost structure, using the expense savings and proceeds from real estate monetization to invest in its digital business, store-related growth strategies, its relaunched loyalty program, and expansion of Bluemercury and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> Backstage. The company also benefits from relationships with key national brand vendors, especially given more acute challenges elsewhere in the department store sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Intensified Strategy Highlights Secular Challenges: In light of ongoing issues and lackluster 2019 performance, management announced a three-year plan, which accelerates its recent strategy of real estate rationalization, cost structure optimization and targeted business re-investment. Major elements of the plan include the closure of 125 (or around 20%) of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> lower-volume stores, primarily in secondary or tertiary markets, to focus management attention on its best performing assets. These stores produce approximately $1.4 billion of revenue (less than 10% of 2019 total) and Fitch assumes minimal EBITDA, and real estate sales are expected to be a continued source of debt reduction over the medium term. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has targeted $700 million in asset sale proceeds over the next three years; near term this could get adversely impacted by dislocation in discretionary retail sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects the 125 store closures could have major repercussions for the affected malls, particularly if reduced traffic and co-tenancy clauses combine to trigger further tenant departures and accelerated reshaping of the mall landscape. As an industry leader, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could stand to benefit if these closures yield another round of broader closures of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> weaker competitors in the apparel and accessories space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company continues to experiment with new and off-mall formats. The company had planned to expand its portfolio of standalone off-price Backstage stores and test a new department store concept called Market by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, both in off-mall locations. As part of its February analyst day, the company shared its target of $1.5 billion in reductions to its cost structure. The company has also targeted major savings in areas like supply chain optimization, store expense reduction and marketing expense efficiency. Gross margin opportunities total $600 million, while SG&A opportunities provide the remaining $900 million. The company also announced New York City will become the company's sole corporate headquarters in a sweep of campus consolidation and headcount reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.5 billion in cost reductions is designed to provide <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> with around $1 billion of business reinvestment opportunity. Major areas of focus include <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> digital business, strengthening customer relationships, in-store enhancements, and private label expansion. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> e-commerce business is around $6 billion, or 25% of sales, and the company is targeting continued growth through site upgrades, improving its mobile app, expanding omnichannel attributes such as in-store pickup of online orders, and potential new features like recommerce and customizable fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch acknowledges <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> proactive approach to real estate portfolio rationalization and efforts to invest in defending share, the heightened retrenchment of the store base and cost cutting required to stabilize operations is evidence of the dislocation in the business and ongoing secular pressure. In addition, a number of these initiatives could be put on hold to preserve liquidity given the current situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Maintains Downward Trajectory: EBITDA in 2019 declined 13% to $2.2 billion given a 0.8% comparable store sales decline and margin declining to 8.6% from 9.8% in 2018. Prior to the recent disruption, Fitch had expected merchandise revenue to decline below $23 billion over the next two to three years on modest comp declines and store closures, and for EBITDA to decline under $2.0 billion over the next three years despite cost reduction efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has paid down over $3 billion in debt over the past four years since 2016, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR ending at 2.9x in 2019. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> financial discipline and adherence to its publicly stated financial policy (leverage of 2.5x to 2.8x, or 2.4x to 2.7x on a Fitch-calculated basis) supported the company's credit profile in the face of operational challenges, although Fitch expects it could be outside of this range through 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating downgrades and Outlook revisions for the department stores reflect the significant business interruption from the coronavirus pandemic and the implications of a downturn in discretionary spending that Fitch expects could extend well into 2021. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, Nordstrom, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> and Dillard's are expected to have sufficient liquidity to manage operations through this downturn, should Fitch's projections come to fruition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Macy's</b> U.S. department store peers include <span class="companylink">Dillard's, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Nordstrom, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corporation</span>. and <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Company, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> (BB+/Negative): Fitch anticipates a sharp increase in leverage to over 11x in 2020 from 2.9x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to approximately $325 million from $2 billion on a revenue decline of nearly 25% to $19.2 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to be around 4x in 2021, assuming revenue declines of around 15% and EBITDA declines of around 40% in 2021 from 2019 levels. Leverage could return to 3x in 2022 assuming a sustained topline recovery. The company ended 2019 with $685 million of cash and recently drew fully on its $1.5 billion unsecured revolver. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> will pay with cash on hand, given the recent drawdown on its $1.5 billion credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings continue to reflect its position as the largest department store chain in the U.S. and Fitch's view of a prolonged timeframe for the company's operating trajectory to stabilize on a lower EBITDA base, given weak mall traffic and heightened competition from alternate channels that include online and off-price. This follows sustained low single digit comparable store sales declines, recent EBITDA margins well below expectations and increased management urgency to address secular challenges, as evidenced by the announcement of 125 store closures and $1.5 billion in cost reductions to support business reinvestment, prior to the recent downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nordstrom (BBB/Negative): Fitch projects adjusted leverage increasing to 7x in 2020 from 3x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to approximately $550 million from $1.6 billion on a sales revenue decline of over 20% to $12 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to decline to the low 3x in 2021, assuming sales declines of around 10% and EBITDA declines of around 20% in 2021 from 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nordstrom's ratings reflect its position as a market share consolidator in the apparel, footwear and accessories space, with its differentiated merchandise and high level of customer service enabling the company to enjoy strong customer loyalty. The company has a well-developed product offering across a diverse portfolio of full line department stores, off-price Nordstrom Rack locations and multiple online channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> (BBB-/Negative): Fitch anticipates <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> leverage to increase to over 6x in 2020 from 2.3x in 2019, based on EBITDA declining to approximately $550 million from $2 billion on a sales decline of 20% to under $16 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to be in the mid 3x in 2021, assuming revenue declines of around 15% and EBITDA declines of around 40% in 2021 from 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> ratings reflect its position as the second largest department store in the U.S. and Fitch's expectation that the company should be able to able to accelerate market share gains post the discretionary downturn. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> has a well-developed omnichannel strategy, with online sales contributing close to 25% of total revenue which should benefit its top-line as retail sales continue to move online. <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> off-mall real estate footprint provides some insulation from mall traffic challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's (BB/Negative): Fitch anticipates EBITDA dropping to under $50 million in 2020 from $392 million in 2019 on a revenue decline of over 20% to $5 billion. Adjusted leverage is expected to be over 2x in 2021, assuming sales declines in the low-teens and EBITDA of approximately $300 million or around 30% lower compared to 2019 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dillard's ratings reflect the company's below-industry-average sales productivity (as measured by sales psf), operating profitability and geographical concentration relative to its larger department store peers, <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span>, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>. The ratings consider Dillard's strong liquidity and minimal debt maturities, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR expected to return to the 2x range in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> (CCC-): Fitch expects <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>'s EBITDA could turn materially negative in 2020 in the range of negative $400 million. While the company ended 2019 with $1.8 billion in liquidity (cash and revolver), the significant disruption from coronavirus have led to heightened liquidity concerns over the next 12 months given the projected cash burn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Below are Fitch's projections prior to disruption related to coronavirus:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Top-line to decline more sharply in 2020 in the mid-single digits driven by negative low-single digit comps, given the disruption from store closings and disruptions from its restructuring initiatives. Declines moderate in 2021 and beyond with top-line contraction of 1% to 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA decline of 5% in 2020 from $2.2 billion in 2019 with continued low-to-mid single digit declines thereafter to under $2 billion in 2021, with EBITDA margins in the low 8% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF after dividends to be modestly negative in 2020 due to cash restructuring charges, and modestly positive thereafter given dividends of $470 million and capex spend of $1 billion annually. This excludes a projected $700 million in net proceeds from asset sales through 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR to remain in the high 2x range, as EBITDA declines are mitigated by proactive debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Below are Fitch's revised projections reflecting the significant business interruption from COVID-19 and the ramifications for a likely downturn in discretionary spending extending well into 2021:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch projects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 2020 revenue could decline nearly 25% to $19.2 billion and EBITDA could decline to approximately $325 million from $2.2 billion, assuming store closures through mid-May and a slow recovery in customer traffic for the remainder of the year. While 2021 revenue and EBITDA should significantly rebound from depressed 2020 levels, Fitch expects 2021 revenue of approximately $21 billion and EBITDA of around $1.3 billion to be over 15% and approximately 40%, respectively, lower than 2019 levels given Fitch's expectations of a likely downturn in discretionary spending that could extend well into late 2021. Fitch's revenue expectations reflect its views that retail discretionary spending will decline 40% in first half 2020, be down mid-to-high single digits in second half 2020, and sales in 2021 will be down 8%-10% from 2019 levels, with declines in department store sales more material on a relative basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Beginning 2022, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could resume low-single digit topline and EBITDA growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is expected to be approximately negative $700 million in 2020, largely due to a $1.9 billion reduction in EBITDA, somewhat mitigated by lower cash taxes, significantly reduced capex and potential working capital benefit. FCF in 2021 could approach positive $300 million as EBITDA improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which was 2.9x in 2019, could climb to over 11x in 2020 and decline to the low 4.0x range in 2021 on EBITDA swings. Adjusted debt/EBITDAR in 2020 is impacted by around 2.0x from <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> decision to draw $1.5 billion on its revolver. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which Fitch expects it could pay down with the recent drawdown on the revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --A stabilization case would require <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to meet Fitch's revised projections that include EBITDA increasing to $1.3 billion in 2021 and adjusted debt/EBITDAR moderating to the low 4x in 2021 and under 3.5x in 2022. --An upgrade, although unlikely at this point, could occur from sustained low single digit positive comps, EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits with EBITDA margins in the high single digits beginning 2022, combined with adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the low 3x. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A negative rating action could result on a more protracted or severe downturn and reduced confidence In <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to return to top line and profitability growth in 2022 such that adjusted debt/EBITDAR is sustained above 4x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ended 2019 with a cash balance of $685 million. On March 20, 2020, the company announced it had fully borrowed on its $1.5 billion revolver to enhance liquidity. Additionally, it announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend beginning the second quarter of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Should Fitch's projections come to fruition, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has sufficient liquidity to manage operations through this downturn. The company has approximately $530 million of debt maturing in January 2021 and $450 million maturing in January 2022, which Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> will pay with cash on hand, given the recent drawdown on its $1.5 billion credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RECOVERY CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not employ a waterfall recovery analysis for issuers assigned ratings in the 'BB' category. The further up the speculative grade continuum a rating moves, the more compressed the notching between the specific classes of issuances becomes. The $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolver and the senior unsecured notes are rated 'BB+'/'RR4', indicating average (31%-50%) recovery prospects.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-06 February 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b>, Inc</span>.'s and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b> Retail Holdings, Inc</span>.'s ratings, including the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to 'BBB-' from 'BBB', and Short-Term IDRs to 'F3' from 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade reflects Fitch's view of a prolonged timeframe for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> operating trajectory to stabilize on a lower EBITDA (Fitch does not include asset sale gains in its EBITDA calculations) base. This follows sustained low single digit comparable store sales declines, EBITDA margins well below expectations and increased management urgency to address secular challenges, as evidenced by the announcement of 125 store closures and $1.5 billion in cost reductions to support business reinvestment. Despite initial expectations of EBITDA stabilization in 2019, EBITDA is projected to decline around 13% on a comps decline of approximately 1%. Fitch now expects EBITDA could modestly decline from approximately $2.2 billion in 2019 toward $2.0 billion over the next two to three years given increased investments to combat ongoing secular challenges, including weak mall traffic and heightened competition from alternate channels that include online and off-price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> credit profile continues to be supported by its leading competitive position, albeit in the challenged department store industry, which allows significant business reinvestment (including capex at around 4% of revenue) to defend market share over time. The rating also considers strong adherence to its financial policy of maintaining Fitch-defined adjusted leverage in the mid-2x range, including over $3 billion of debt reduction over the past four years. Proactive debt reduction has allowed <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to maintain adjusted debt/EBITDAR at or below 3.0x, despite EBITDA declines. Fitch would consider an upgrade back to the mid-'BBB' level should confidence improve in <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ability to sustain modestly positive comps and stabilize its EBITDA. A negative rating action could occur if weak operating performance continued, yielding further concerns about the long-term trajectory of mall-based businesses, or if adjusted debt/EBITDAR is sustained above 3.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Business Model Evolution: While most U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers are battling competitive incursion from online and value-oriented players, sales weakness is most pronounced for mid-tier apparel and accessories retailers. Traditional department stores and specialty apparel retailers have been facing competitive threats for at least a decade. Consumers are seeking out value-oriented retailers offering attractive and acceptable-quality merchandise. Spending has moved toward fast fashion retailers such as Zara (owned by <span class="companylink">Inditex</span>), Uniqlo (owned by <span class="companylink">Fast Retailing</span>) and <span class="companylink">H&M</span>, and off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx and Marshalls (owned by <span class="companylink">The TJX Companies, Inc</span>.) and <span class="companylink">Ross Stores, Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, apparel purchases have been rapidly moving online, putting significant pressure on in-store sales. Retailers are investing heavily in omnichannel platforms and rationalizing their physical footprints. These changes have driven down EBITDA margins and reduced cash flow. Successful retailers in the space have to continue to ramp up investments in the omnichannel model, rightsize their store footprint and have a differentiated product and service offering, including a well-developed value message, to draw customers in. Financially and operationally stronger department stores such as <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, Nordstrom and <span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> should be able to at least maintain their share of the apparel and accessories space as unprofitable inventory and square footage are removed from the system. These retailers have well-developed omnichannel strategies, which should benefit their top lines as retail sales continue to move online. These retailers are expected to benefit from the acceleration of store closings and restructuring activity from cash-constrained specialty apparel players and department stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Longer term, Fitch views <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> as well positioned to accelerate share gains in the mid-tier department store space as it continues to invest in its omnichannel and other growth initiatives. In recent years, the company has proactively rationalized its store footprint and reduced its cost structure, using the expense savings and proceeds from real estate monetization to invest in its digital business, store-related growth strategies, its relaunched loyalty program, and expansion of Bluemercury and <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> Backstage. The company also benefits from relationships with key national brand vendors, especially given more acute challenges elsewhere in the department store sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Intensified Strategy Highlights Secular Challenges: In light of ongoing issues and lackluster 2019 performance, management announced a three-year plan, which accelerates its recent strategy of real estate rationalization, cost structure optimization and targeted business re-investment. Major elements of the plan include the closure of 125 (or around 20%) of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> lower-volume stores, primarily in secondary or tertiary markets, to focus management attention on its best performing assets. These stores produce approximately $1.4 billion of revenue (less than 10% of total) and Fitch assumes minimal EBITDA, and real estate sales are expected to be a continued source of debt reduction over the medium term. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> currently targets $700 million in asset sale proceeds over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects the 125 store closures could have major repercussions for the affected malls, particularly if reduced traffic and cotenancy clauses combine to trigger further tenant departures and accelerated reshaping of the mall landscape. As an industry leader, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> could stand to benefit if these closures yield another round of broader closures of <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> weaker competitors in the apparel and accessories space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company continues to experiment with new and off-mall formats, and in 2020 will expand its portfolio of standalone off-price Backstage stores and test a new department store concept called Market by <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span>, both in off-mall locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company has also targeted $1.5 billion in reductions to its cost structure, with initiatives through its business operation. New York City will become the company's sole corporate headquarters in a sweep of campus consolidation and headcount reduction. The company has also targeted major savings in areas like supply chain optimization, store expense reduction and marketing expense efficiency. Gross margin opportunities total $600 million, while SG&A opportunities provide the remaining $900 million. Given the magnitude of changes in the business, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> believes operational disruption will contribute to its negative 2020 comps guidance, which is in the negative 2.5% to negative 1.5% range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $1.5 billion in cost reductions is designed to provide <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> with around $1 billion of business reinvestment opportunity. Major areas of focus include <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> digital business, strengthening customer relationships, in-store enhancements, and private label expansion. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> e-commerce business is around $6 billion, or over 20% of sales, and the company is targeting continued growth through site upgrades, improving its mobile app, expanding omnichannel attributes such as in-store pickup of online orders, and potential new features like recommerce and customizable fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> strengthening customer relationships goal is grounded in data analytics, which can help predict customer behavior and allow the company to optimize marketing, merchandising and promotional cadence while tailoring key aspects of the <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> experience to specific customer segments defined based on attributes. The company has been successful in relaunching its loyalty program and sees further opportunities to drive engagement and sales with program enhancements. In recent years, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has rolled out key growth initiatives, including selling enhancements and new features like food and beverage options or larger furniture departments, to around 150 stores, spending around $2.5 million per store. The company has seen nearly a 2% lift in store sales following these investments, and has identified 150 more stores that will receive some of these initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With regard to its private brands such as I·N·C, Alfani, and Charter Club, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is targeting 25% revenue penetration, from a Fitch-estimated 20% level today. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> would need to invest in its design, marketing, and merchandising functions to drive above-average growth in these areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch acknowledges <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> proactive approach to real estate portfolio rationalization and efforts to invest in defending share, the heightened retrenchment of the store base and cost cutting required to stabilize operations is evidence of the dislocation in the business and ongoing secular pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Maintains Downward Trajectory: EBITDA in 2019 is expected to be down nearly 13% to $2.2 billion given about a 1.0% comparable store sales decline and margin declining from 9.8% to 8.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch had originally expected EBITDA to trough at around $2.5 billion in 2019 with margins settling around 10% off of flat comparable sales growth and $25 billion in sales (ex credit card revenue). Results have tracked below expectations, particularly dragged by a difficult second quarter for margins with heavy markdowns and steeper top-line deceleration in the third quarter with softening international tourism and weakening performance at lower tier malls. As a result, actual comparable sales for the full year experienced a moderate decline with total sales contracting in the low single digits to $24.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Near term, the company expects comps sales declines (2020 guidance is for a decline in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%) driven by the current trajectory of the business coupled with continued challenged performance in mall-based retail, disruption from significant structural changes to reset cost base, and a still healthy but slower growth economic environment relative to prior years. Fitch expects merchandise revenue to decline below $23 billion over the next two to three years on modest comp declines and store closures. Assuming negative comp trends continue, Fitch expects EBITDA could decline further from around $2.2 billion in 2019 toward $2.0 billion over the next three years despite cost reduction efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adjusted Debt/EBITDAR at Mid-to-High 2x through Debt Reduction: <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> has paid down over $3 billion in debt over the past four years since 2016, with adjusted debt/EBITDAR projected at 2.7x in 2019. As part of its investor presentation, the company guided to $700 million to $1 billion in debt reduction over the next three years, which should support adjusted debt/EBITDAR remaining near 2.7x should Fitch's projections of EBITDA declines come to fruition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> financial discipline and adherence to its publicly stated financial policy (leverage of 2.5x to 2.8x, or 2.4x to 2.7x on a Fitch-calculated basis) continues to support the company's credit profile in the face of operational challenges. Fitch expects debt reduction will largely come from asset sales as FCF is projected to be near breakeven over the next two to three years. However, Fitch notes that <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> maintains very healthy capex levels of around $1 billion plus a dividend of nearly $500 million. These expenditures, plus discretionary business reinvestment of the planned $1.5 billion in cost savings, would provide <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> with ample financial flexibility if secular challenges persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> 'BBB-' ratings reflects Fitch's view of a prolonged timeframe for <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> operating trajectory to stabilize on a lower EBITDA base, following sustained low single digit comparable store sales declines, EBITDA margins well below expectations and increased management urgency to address secular challenges as evidenced by the announcement of 125 store closures and $1.5 billion in cost reductions to support business reinvestment. Fitch expects EBITDA could modestly decline from approximately $2.2 billion in 2019 toward $2.0 billion over the next two to three years given increased investments to combat ongoing secular challenges, including weak mall traffic and heightened competition from alternate channels including online and off-price. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> credit profile continues to be supported by its leading competitive position, which allows significant business reinvestment to defend market share over time and considers strong adherence to its financial policy of maintaining Fitch-defined adjusted leverage in the mid-2x range, via significant debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> peers in the department store space include <span class="companylink">Nordstrom Inc</span>. (BBB+/Negative), <span class="companylink">Kohl's Corporation</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Dillard's, Inc</span>. (BBB-/Stable), and <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Company, Inc</span>. (CCC+). The three investment-grade chains other than Dillard's continue to invest aggressively in their businesses while maintaining healthy cash flow and reasonable leverage metrics. These retailers have well-developed omnichannel strategies, which should benefit their top-line over time as retail sales continue to move online. Dillard's 'BBB-' ratings reflect the company's below-industry-average sales productivity, operating profitability (with EBITDA trending in the $400 million and margin in the mid-6% range) and geographical concentration relative to its higher-rated department store peers, offset by strong liquidity and reasonable leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) at around mid-1x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">J. C. Penney Company, Inc</span>.'s 'CCC+' IDR reflects continued market share losses and declining EBITDA, with lack of visibility for a material turnaround, although there are no near-term liquidity concerns. Fitch expects annual EBITDA could remain under $500 million over the next 12-36 months and adjusted debt/EBITDAR to trend at 9x in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch comps to decline in the low single digits over the next three years, with 2020 experiencing more sharp declines as a marked transition year for the business and as mall-based retail challenges continue. Total revenue, inclusive of credit card income, is expected to decline from approximately $25 billion in 2019 toward $23.3 billion by 2022, including around $1 billion negative topline impact from store closures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA is expected to contract nearly 13% in 2019 to just under $2.2 billion. Given margins compressed around 8% and weakening top line results, Fitch expects EBITDA could continue to deteriorate towards under $2 billion by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF after dividends is expected to be modest over the next two to three years. <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> is expected to maintain its existing dividend of nearly $500 million and healthy capex spend of $1 billion, or around 4% of revenue. The company also expects to incur $270 million to $290 million in cash restructuring charges related to its expense reduction initiatives, most of which Fitch expects will be in 2020. Excluded from FCF is an expectation of around $700 million in net proceeds from asset sales to occur over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR is projected at 2.7x in 2019 and could remain near this level over the rating horizon as EBITDA declines are mitigated by proactive debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--While Fitch is not currently projecting a U.S. recession or significant consumer slowdown in 2020/2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> discretionary accessories and apparel focus puts the company at risk of sales and EBITDA volatility in a downturn. Given the company's access to a $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and actions it can take to preserve liquidity such as pull back on capex or dividends, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> would be adequately positioned to withstand a macroeconomic downturn. The company could benefit longer term if a consumer downturn negatively affects weaker apparel players, yielding retrenchment and store closures by competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained low single digit positive comps, EBITDA growth in the low to mid-single digits, and EBITDA margin returning to 10%+, in combination with maintaining its publicly stated leverage target in the 2.5x-2.8x range (using the company's calculation methodology, which translates into 2.4x-2.7x on Fitch's calculation that capitalizes rent at 8x) or under 3x on a Fitch adjusted leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Weaker-than expected EBITDA performance and/or insufficient debt reduction such that adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) is sustained above 3.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Alternatively, Fitch could downgrade <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> ratings on reduced confidence in the company's longer-term business profile or ability to stabilize its operating trajectory, as evidenced by continued declines in revenue in the low single digits and EBITDA trending well below $2 billion, even if adjusted debt/EBITDAR remains below 3.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Liquidity was supported by a cash balance of $300 million as of Nov. 2, 2019. In addition, <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> had full availability under its $1.5 billion credit facility due May 2024. FCF after dividends is expected to be around $100 million in 2019 and breakeven to modestly positive beginning 2020. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Macy's</b></span> to generate around $700 million in asset sale proceeds from 2020-2022, with proceeds used to reduce debt, in line with the company's publicly articulated financial policy and guidance as of Feb. 5, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Financial statement adjustments that depart materially from those contained in the published financial statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are disclosed below:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Historical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock based compensation and exclude gains related to asset sales. For example, Fitch added back $63 million in noncash stock based compensation to its EBITDA calculation in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fitch has adjusted the historical and projected debt by adding 8x yearly operating lease expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Copyright © 2020 by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings Ltd</span>. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>

<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>. is registered with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</span> as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the "NRSRO").

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the "non-NRSROs") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.</p>
