<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-20 June 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has maintained <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Parent, Inc.</span>'s (Frontier) and its rated subsidiaries' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'B+'. The ratings remain on Ratings Watch Positive (RWP) following <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications, Inc.</span>'s (A-/Stable) pending acquisition of the company, which is expected to close by 1Q26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> to refinance all of <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s outstanding debt. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects to resolve the Rating Watch at closing or if the transaction does not go through as expected. The ratings impact approximately $11.7 billion of outstanding debt at March 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >All issue-level ratings have also been maintained, except senior unsecured issuances at Frontier Florida LLC that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> upgraded to 'BB+' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR1' from 'B+'/'RR4', as the agency expects the debt could be repaid or defeased upon the company drawing on its new $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan in a default scenario. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> Acquisition Credit Positive: The pending acquisition by 'A-' rated <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> has positive credit implications for <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> and would reduce its liquidity and leverage risk. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> has a strong balance sheet and generates significant pre-dividend FCF that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects could range from $18 billion to $19 billion annually in the next few years. This provides <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> with significantly more capital access as it scales its fiber network to its 10 million passings target and beyond. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> also has a much stronger national brand that could benefit the operator and has indicated it would refinance all of <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s outstanding debt upon deal closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Elevated Leverage: On a standalone basis before considering the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition, EBITDA leverage is near 5.4x as of March 2025. It could increase to the high-5.0x range through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast period. EBITDA net leverage is modestly lower near 5.1x, but the company is aggressively spending on its fiber expansion and so its cash does not provide meaningful protection to repay existing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s leverage increased materially since 2021 due to heavy capital spending to fund its fiber deployment. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span>'s acquisition will enable the company to continue pace with its fiber expansion strategy and shift away from copper network and legacy services offerings. However, it is unclear what the future financing path would look like if the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> deal is not completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fiber-Focused Capital Allocation: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s capital allocation policy following its April 2021 bankruptcy emergence largely centers on accelerated investment in fiber to the home (FTTH) and targeting fiber deployment to small and medium businesses, enterprises and the wholesale market. Management targets net leverage in the mid-3x range, but it is already well above this range (reported 4.9x at March 2025). <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive investment plan will expand the deployment of fiber to more than 10 million locations, or two-thirds of its current footprint, versus 8.1 million as of March 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fiber Opportunity Mitigates Risks: Fiber expansion comes with execution risks, mitigated by secular growth, and opportunity demonstrated through fiber customer growth and several years of consecutive net adds with lower churn rates. Since 2022, broadband fiber churn for consumer/business customers has been in the 1.2%-1.5% range versus 1.7%-2.5% for copper customers. Potential to capture additional broadband share is underscored by its footprint, with limited competition in roughly 85% of its markets. Fiber-served locations offer significant upside, as fiber penetration rates are near 31% versus 47% for its base markets (markets in which it has had fiber longer).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Cash Flows: Heavy capital intensity and cash burn related to its fiber build-out are negative for the credit profile, although the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition solves for FCF issues. FCF deficits accelerated meaningfully in recent years and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> calculates was nearly $4.5 billion cumulatively in 2022-2024. Nearly all cash flow deterioration is from significantly increased capex spend of $2.7 to $3.0 billion annually from 2022-2024 versus low-$1.0 billion in 2019-2020. FCF deficits will continue in the next few years and <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is reliant on the capital markets to fund its expansion strategy, if the acquisition were terminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Margins Improving: Accelerated fiber deployments are improving profitability, and the ongoing fiber mix shift could help drive future margin expansion. Reported EBITDA margins increased 90 basis points in 2024. Management has indicated EBITDA margins could expand to the mid- to high-40% range over time, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates margins expanding only to low-40% by 2027-2028. Fiber comprised 70% of 2024 EBITDA and the ongoing mix shift to fiber should help profitability, as fiber requires fewer on-site service calls versus copper and lower call volumes generally. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has also been aggressively cutting costs since mid-2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Competition Intense: Competition in telecom is intense and increasingly diverse as more providers and technology solutions have entered <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s end markets. This is further evidenced by <span class="companylink">Verizon</span>'s move to bulk up in wireline offerings via its acquisition of Frontier. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has a strong presence within its footprint, but other providers have also been scaling out their own networks and broadband service offerings. Additionally, U.S. wireless companies have now become a viable alternative internet solution with fixed wireless access offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> links the IDRs of Frontier and its subsidiaries based on a strong parent/weak subsidiary approach. The IDRs are equalized under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria based on an analysis incorporating high strategic and operational incentives and low legal incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has higher exposure to the consumer market compared with wireline peer <span class="companylink">Lumen Technologies, Inc.</span> (CCC+), and <span class="companylink">Windstream Services, LLC</span> (B/Ratings Watch Evolving). The consumer market faces secular challenges (particularly in voice/video), with legacy revenue declines in older copper-based communication technologies being only somewhat offset by growth in faster, fiber-based technology. Incumbent wireline operators face competition for broadband customers from cable operators, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc.</span> (BB+/RWP).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> also faces emerging broadband competition from 5G wireless operators offering fixed wireless access, including T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc.</span>. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive fiber investments to have long-term benefits, but it will require significant near-term costs that will weigh on cash flow generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is less competitive in the enterprise market, although its enterprise business is less exposed to large enterprise accounts than its larger peers. In enterprise, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> and <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>. All three companies have an advantage as national or multinational companies due to their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. <span class="companylink">Windstream Services, LLC</span> is somewhat smaller than <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> and is a hybrid that operates as an incumbent in rural markets and as a business services provider with its enterprise and wholesale units, which compete nationally. Compared with <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> have significantly larger scale, greater business diversification and meaningfully lower financial leverage as investment grade operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues grow modestly in the next few years, with fiber growth offset by copper revenue declines. Assumes high single-digit growth in data/internet services, offset by double-digit declines in voice/video;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins expand to low-40% over ratings horizon, benefiting from a mix shift to fiber (higher margin);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash taxes and restructuring costs comprise a modest use of cash flow in the next few years, with taxes kept low due to operating losses and tax loss carryforwards;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition is not modeled into <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case forecast, but the company projects the deal to be completed in early 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For entities rated 'B+' and below (where default is closer and recovery prospects are more meaningful to investors) <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> undertakes a tailored, or bespoke, analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. The resulting debt instrument rating includes a Recovery Rating (from RR1 to RR6) and is notched from the IDR accordingly. In this analysis, there are three steps: (i) estimating the distressed enterprise value (EV); (ii) estimating creditor claims; and (iii) distribution of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We assumed <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> would emerge from a default scenario under the going concern approach versus liquidation. Key assumptions used in the recovery analysis are as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a going-concern EBITDA of approximately $1.7 billion, which is roughly 20% below the company's current run-rate EBITDA (less certain EBITDA from Texas and Florida that have been securitized). Reduced EBITDA of this magnitude in a bankruptcy scenario could imply increased competition has pressured revenue or profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> excludes from its recovery waterfall debt amounts outstanding at <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s issuer subsidiary for its Texas securitization, Frontier Issuer LLC, and the $1.5 billion DDTL outstanding at Frontier Tampa Bay FL Fiber 1 LLC. The Texas ABS debt and the Florida DDTL were issued out of bankruptcy remote subsidiaries, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes would not be part of a corporate-level bankruptcy. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has, however, included residual cash flows (discounted for a stressed scenario) from the Texas portfolio as part of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery EBITDA assumptions as well as a portion of the EBITDA from the Florida portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a 6.0x multiple, using a blended approach of part of the business being copper-based (legacy) at 4.0x and the larger part of EBITDA now being fiber (growth) at 7.0x. This multiple is validated based upon historic industry trading multiples, M&A transactions in the industry, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> bankruptcy case studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a fully drawn $925 million revolver and $1.5 billion Frontier Tampa Bay DDTL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--For instruments issued by Frontier Florida LLC, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria indicates unsecured instruments for 'B+' IDR issuers are capped at 'RR3' but this cap may be exceeded in instances when the issuer is a structurally senior subsidiary issuer in a multi-level corporate group structure, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes applies in this scenario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition is terminated;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained above 5.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--More aggressive capital or financial policies that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as negative for the credit profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Verizon</span> completes the acquisition as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >If the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition is terminated, the following are factors that could lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage, defined as debt/EBITDA, sustained below 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue and/or EBITDA growth expected to be sustained at mid-single digit percentage or higher;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained positive FCF generation could also lead <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> to reassess the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> had $506 million of unrestricted cash at March 2025, undrawn capacity on its $925 million revolving credit facility and warehouse facilities that include a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan (DDTL) facility (with the ability to increase up to $750 million). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Frontier to have material FCF deficits of nearly $4 billion cumulatively in 2025-2027, but the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition will notably improve its access to liquidity and capital. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> would remain heavily reliant on the capital markets in the future if the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition were not completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has roughly $11.7 billion of debt outstanding as of March 2025, including: $2.4 billion of securitization debt (asset-backed debt collateralized by the company's Texas and Florida fiber footprints), roughly $5.7 billion of senior secured debt, $2.8 billion of second-lien debt and $750 million of unsecured subsidiary debt.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-06 January 2025: <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Parent, Inc.</span>’s (Frontier) and its subsidiaries’ ‘B+’ Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) remain unchanged following the company’s recent debt agreement and announced refinancing, according to <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>’s ratings are on Rating Watch Positive, reflecting <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s expectation that the company’s debt could be refinanced upon closing of the acquisition by the higher-rated <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc.</span> (A-/Stable).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Last week, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Frontier Tampa Bay FL Fiber 1 LLC, had entered into a new credit agreement. This included a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan facility and incremental capacity of up to $750 million. The new facilities are secured by first-priority pledges of equity interests and security interests in substantially all owned assets of the company’s fiber network assets in certain Tampa, FL metro neighborhoods. As the facilities are drawn down and other debt is repaid, this could affect certain <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> issue-level ratings over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Proceeds from the new term loans will be used to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes, including <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>’s ongoing fiber buildout plan. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has been executing on an aggressive, multi-year fiber buildout plan across much of its footprint. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects total capex spending on a standalone basis in the low-$3.0 billion range per year in 2025-2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> also announced it is seeking an amendment to and repricing of its existing $1.025 billion term loan due July 2031. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes a successful term loan repricing could lead to some interest savings in 2025 and possibly beyond, if the Verizon acquisition is not completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> shareholders approved the Verizon acquisition in November 2024, and the deal is estimated to complete by 1Q26, with regulatory and state approval as key factors before completion. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>’s fundamentals have been solid in recent quarters, with revenue up 2.5% and EBITDA up 5% for the nine-month period ended September 2024. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes this improved performance in 2024, compared to previous revenue declines, evidences the traction gained in the company’s fiber transition strategy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-09 September 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has placed <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Parent, Inc.</span>'s (Frontier) and its subsidiaries' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and debt ratings on Rating Watch Positive (RWP). These actions follow <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications, Inc.</span>'s (A-/Stable) announcement it will acquire the company in an all-cash transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also upgraded <b>Frontier Communications</b> Holdings, LLC's second lien secured notes and Frontier Florida LLC's senior unsecured notes. The upgrades are based on debt changes since the 2Q 2024 earnings statement, which affected <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery analysis. The Long-Term IDRs for each rated issuer are 'B+'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the higher-rated, investment grade <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> to refinance all of <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s outstanding debt. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> expects to close the acquisition in approximately 18 months. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects to resolve the Rating Watch at closing or if the transaction does not go through as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> identified an error in its recovery analysis of Frontier that incorrectly led the senior unsecured notes issued by Frontier Florida to be rated 'B-'/'RR5'. Correcting the error, in combination with other changes made in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s latest recovery analysis, has led to a two-notch upgrade to 'B+'/'RR4'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> Acquisition Credit Positive: The pending acquisition by 'A-' rated <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> has positive credit implications for <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> and would reduce its liquidity and leverage risk. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> has a strong balance sheet and generates significant pre-dividend FCF that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects could range from $18 billion to $19 billion annually in the next few years. This provides <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> with significantly more capital access as it scales its fiber network to its 10 million passings target and beyond. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> also has a much stronger national brand that could benefit the operator and has indicated it would refinance all of <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s outstanding debt upon deal closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Elevated Leverage: On a standalone basis before considering the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition, EBITDA leverage is high near 5.3x as of June 2024. It could remain in the mid-5.0x range through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast period. While EBITDA net leverage is lower in the mid-4.0x range, the company is aggressively spending on its fiber expansion strategy and so its sizable cash does not provide meaningful protection to repay existing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s leverage increased materially since 2021 due to heavy capital spending to fund its fiber deployment. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span>'s acquisition will enable the company to continue pace with its fiber expansion strategy and shift away from copper network and legacy services offerings. However, it is unclear what the future financing path would look like if the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> deal is not completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fiber-Focused Capital Allocation: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s capital allocation policy following its April 2021 bankruptcy emergence largely centers on accelerated investment in fiber to the home (FTTH) and targeting fiber deployment to small and medium businesses, enterprises and the wholesale market. Management targets net leverage in the mid-3x range, but it is already well above this range (4.6x at June 2024). <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive investment plan will expand the deployment of fiber to more than 10 million locations, or two-thirds of its current footprint, versus 7.2 million as of June 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fiber Opportunity Mitigates Risks: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> faces both opportunity and execution risk in growing its fiber-based revenue. The risk is somewhat mitigated by secular growth, as evidenced by the successful addition of fiber customers. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has experienced several years of consecutive quarters of net adds and lower churn in fiber. Broadband fiber churn has generally been in the 1.3%-1.4% range for consumer/business customers since 2022 compared to roughly 1.7%-2.0% for its copper customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The opportunity to capture additional broadband share is highlighted by a footprint that has only one or no competitors in approximately 85% of its markets. The new locations to be served by fiber have material upside, as penetration rates for legacy, less-competitive copper broadband services are in the low-teens percentage range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Cash Flows: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views heavy capital intensity and cash burn related to its fiber build-out strategy as negative factors for the credit profile, although the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition solves for the company's FCF issues. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> calculates FCF deficits accelerated meaningfully in the past few years and could be near $1.7 billion in 2024 versus $1.9 billion (2023) and $1.4 billion (2022). Nearly all cash flow deterioration is from significantly increased capex spend of more than $3.0 billion annually versus the low-$1.0 billion range in 2019-2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF deficits will continue in the next few years and that the company would be reliant on the capital markets to fund its fiber expansion strategy, if the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition were terminated. The company has the ability to pull back on fiber spending/capex in order to manage its cash burn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Margins Improving: Accelerated fiber deployments are improving profitability, and the ongoing fiber mix shift could help drive future margin expansion. Reported EBITDA margins increased 120 basis points YoY in 1H24. Management guided margins could expand to the mid- to high-40% range over time, although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates margin expanding only to low-40% by 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fiber now comprises roughly two thirds of total EBITDA and the ongoing mix shift to fiber should help profitability, as fiber requires fewer on-site service calls versus copper and lower call volumes generally. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has also been aggressively cutting costs and is believed to have cut more than $580 million since mid-2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Competition Intense: Competition in telecom is intense and increasingly diverse as more providers and technology solutions have entered <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s end markets. This is further evidenced by <span class="companylink">Verizon</span>'s move to bulk up in wireline offerings via its acquisition of Frontier. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has a strong presence within its footprint, but other providers have also been scaling out their own networks and broadband service offerings. Additionally, U.S. wireless companies have now become a viable alternative internet solution with fixed wireless access offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> links the IDRs of Frontier and its subsidiaries based on a strong parent/weak subsidiary approach. The IDRs are equalized under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria based on an analysis incorporating high strategic and operational incentives and low legal incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has higher exposure to the consumer market compared with wireline peer <span class="companylink">Lumen Technologies, Inc.</span> (CCC+), and Windstream Services, LLC (B/RWE). The consumer market faces secular challenges (particularly in voice/video), with legacy revenue declines in older copper-based communication technologies being only somewhat offset by growth in faster, fiber-based technology. Incumbent wireline operators face competition for broadband customers from cable operators, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> rates Charter's indirect subsidiary <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> BB+/Stable).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> also faces emerging broadband competition from 5G wireless operators offering fixed wireless access, including T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc.</span> (A-/Stable). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive fiber investments to have long-term benefits, but it will require significant near-term costs that will weigh on cash flow generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is less competitive in the enterprise market, although its enterprise business is less exposed to large enterprise accounts than its larger peers. In enterprise, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> and <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>. All three companies have an advantage as national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Windstream Services, LLC is somewhat smaller than <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> and is a hybrid that operates as an incumbent in rural markets and as a business services provider with its enterprise and wholesale units, which compete nationally. Compared with <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> have significantly larger scale, greater business diversification and also meaningfully lower financial leverage as investment grade operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues grow modestly in the next few years, with fiber growth offset by copper-based declines. Assumes mid-single digit growth in data & internet services, offset by double-digit declines in Voice & Video. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition is not modeled into <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins expand to low-40% over ratings horizon, benefiting from a mix shift to fiber (higher margin);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash taxes and restructuring costs comprise a modest use of cash flow in the next few years, with taxes kept low due to operating losses and tax loss carryforwards;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage remains in the mid-5.0x range, or near current levels, over the rating horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For entities rated 'B+' and below (where default is closer and recovery prospects are more meaningful to investors) <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> undertakes a tailored, or bespoke, analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. The resulting debt instrument rating includes a Recovery Rating (from 'RR1' to 'RR6'), and is notched from the Issuer Default Rating accordingly. In this analysis, there are three steps: (i) estimating the distressed enterprise value (EV); (ii) estimating creditor claims; and (iii) distribution of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We assumed <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> would emerge from a default scenario under the going concern approach versus liquidation. Key assumptions used in the recovery analysis are as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Going Concern (GC) EBITDA: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a GC EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion, which is more than 10% below the company's current run-rate EBITDA (less EBITDA from Texas). Reduced EBITDA of this magnitude in a bankruptcy scenario could imply increased competition has pressured revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> excludes from its recovery waterfall debt amounts outstanding at <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s issuer subsidiary for its Texas securitization, Frontier Issuer LLC. This entity is a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes this entity would not be part of a corporate-level bankruptcy. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has, however, included residual cash flows (discounted for a stressed scenario) as part of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery EBITDA assumptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EV Multiple: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a 5.5x multiple, using a blended approach of roughly 50% of business being copper-based (legacy) at 4.0x and 50% being fiber (growth) at 7.0x. This multiple is validated based upon historic industry trading multiples, M&A transactions in the industry, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> bankruptcy case studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Verizon</span> completes the acquisition as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >If the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition is terminated, the following could also be factors that could lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage, defined as debt/EBITDA, sustained below 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue and/or EBITDA growth expected to be sustained at mid-single digit percentage or higher;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained positive FCF generation could also lead <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> to reassess the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition is terminated;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained above 5.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--More aggressive capital or financial policies that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as negative for the credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Profile: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> had approximately $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments at June 2024, as well as undrawn capacity on its $900 million revolving credit facility (upsized to $925 million in July 2024) and $500 million available on capacity on its secured variable funding (VFN) notes. On July 1, 2024, the VFN notes facility was amended to reduce its capacity to $0, with the ability to increase up to $500 million in the future upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The revolver expires in April 2028.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> to have material FCF deficits of more than $3.2 billion cumulatively in 2024-2026, but the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition will notably improve its access to liquidity and capital. Projected negative FCFs over <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ratings horizon, on a standalone basis prior to the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition, are due to the capital-intensive nature of the business in conjunction with an aggressive build-out of fiber across its footprint. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> would remain heavily reliant on the capital markets in the future if the <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> acquisition were not completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Profile: Pro forma for recent debt issuances and amendments, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has roughly $11.6 billion of debt outstanding and its debt structure consists of various sources of capital including: $2.4 billion of securitization debt that was raised in 2023-2024 (asset-backed debt collateralized by the company's Texas fiber footprint), roughly $5.7 billion of senior secured debt, $2.8 billion of second-lien debt and $750 million of unsecured subsidiary debt. Its first lien debt includes a $925 million senior secured revolving credit facility and $1.0 billion of term loans outstanding. Nearly all of the company's debt matures between 2027-2031 and, thus, there is some maturity concentration risk although <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> expects to refinance all of the company's existing debt upon closing its acquisition of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> was founded in the 1930s and is the fourth largest U.S. incumbent local exchange carrier providing data and Internet services (66% of 1H24 revenue), wireline voice (22%), and wireline video service (6%) to residential and business customers.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-13 June 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned issue-level ratings of 'BB+'/'RR1' to a new term loan issuance by <b>Frontier Communications</b> Holdings, LLC. The entity's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), as well as the IDRs of its parent, <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Parent, Inc.</span> (Frontier), and various subsidiaries are currently rated 'B+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Proceeds from the new term loan will be used to repay a $1.4 billion term loan and extend the company's maturity profile on its term loan borrowings from 2027 to 2031. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> to use more than half of the proceeds from a recent ABS offering to reduce its total term loan debt balance outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that continued fiber expansion in the next few years will require additional capital raises that will keep financial leverage high and free cash flow meaningfully negative over the ratings horizon. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could stabilize the IDR at 'B+' if <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> displays continued EBITDA expansion in the next couple of years, combined with EBITDA leverage sustained in the low- to mid-5.0x range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Elevated Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates EBITDA leverage will be in the mid-5.0x range pro forma for the term loan and could remain in the low- to mid-5.0x range through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast period. EBITDA net leverage is lower in the mid-4.0x range, but the company is aggressively spending on its fiber expansion strategy. As a result, its sizable cash does not provide significant protection to repay existing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage increased materially in 2022-2023 due to heavy capital spending to fund fiber deployment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes this carries execution risk related to both subscriber adoption and build cost. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has flexibility to adapt the pace of its capital spending, but this is somewhat constrained by the need to offset revenue erosion from its copper network and certain legacy services. It has material cash and short-term investments of roughly $1.9 billion pro forma for the offering, which should enable much of its near-term fiber build plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Allocation: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s capital allocation policy, following its April 2021 bankruptcy emergence, largely centers on accelerated plans to invest in fiber to the home (FTTH) and fiber deployment for small and medium businesses, enterprises and the wholesale market. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> targets net leverage in the mid-3x range, although it is above this range following the acceleration of its fiber build (mid-4.0x as of March 2024).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive investment plan will expand fiber to more than 10 million locations, or two-thirds of its current footprint. As of March 2024, the company has 6.8 million fiber passings versus its target of 10 million. Penetration rates on the base fiber network are 45%. New build penetration is lower on average with a target penetration rate of 25%-30% after 24 months, but are expected to reach similar penetration to the base network over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fiber Opportunity Mitigates Risks: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views both opportunity and execution risks for <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> to grow its fiber-based revenue. Risks are somewhat mitigated by secular growth, evidenced by success in adding fiber customers, with several years of consecutive quarters of net adds and lower churn. The opportunity to capture additional broadband share is highlighted by a footprint that has only one or no competitors in approximately 86% of its markets. New locations served by fiber have material upside, as penetration rates for the company's legacy copper broadband network are in the low-teens percentage range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Cash Flows: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views heavy capital intensity and cash burn related to its fiber build-out strategy as constraining the IDR. FCF deficits accelerated in the past few years at $1.9 billion in 2023 versus $1.3 billion (2022) and $900+ million (2021). Nearly all CF deterioration is from significantly increased capex spend of $3.2 billion in 2023 versus the low-$1.0 billion range in 2019-2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF deficits will persist in the near-term and makes the company reliant on the capital markets to fund its fiber expansion. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has the ability to pull back on fiber spending/capex in order to manage its cash burn, but this would prolong the time it will take to achieve its targeted goal to reach 10 million fiber passings (previously targeted by YE 2025).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Margins Improving: Accelerated fiber deployments are improving profitability, and the ongoing fiber mix shift could drive margin expansion over time. Reported EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points yoy in 1Q24 and 110 basis points in 2023. Management guided margins could expand to the mid- to high-40% range over time (high-30% today), although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates more conservatively at low-40% by 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes fiber is now more than 60% of EBITDA and the ongoing mix shift to fiber should help profitability, as fiber requires fewer on-site service calls versus copper and lower call volumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additionally, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has been aggressively cutting costs, and is believed to have cut more than $500 million from mid-2021 through YE 2023. Growing EBITDA combined with increased fiber penetration should enable the company to delever its balance sheet in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Competition Intense: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views competition in telecom as intense and increasingly diverse. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has a strong presence within its footprint, often only competing with one other wireline provider, but other providers have also been building out their own networks. Cable companies, fiber "overbuilders", satellite providers, among others continually seek increased market share in broadband services. Additionally, U.S. wireless companies have now become a viable alternative internet solution with fixed wireless access given increased 5G speeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> links the IDRs of Frontier and its subsidiaries based on a strong parent/weak subsidiary approach. The IDRs are equalized under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria based on an analysis incorporating high strategic and operational incentives and low legal incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has higher exposure to the consumer market compared with wireline peer <span class="companylink">Lumen Technologies, Inc.</span> (CCC+), and Windstream Services, LLC (B/Watch Evolving). The consumer market faces secular challenges (particularly in voice/video), with legacy revenue declines in older copper-based communication technologies being only somewhat offset by growth in faster, fiber-based technology. Incumbent wireline operators face competition for broadband customers from cable operators, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> rates Charter's indirect subsidiary <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> BB+/Stable).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> also faces emerging broadband competition from 5G wireless operators offering fixed wireless access, including T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc.</span> (A-/Stable). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive fiber investments as having long-term benefits but will require significant near-term costs that will weigh on cash flow generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is less competitive in the enterprise market, although its enterprise business has some differences compared to larger peers as it is less exposed to large enterprise accounts. In enterprise, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> and <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>. All three companies have an advantage as national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Windstream Services, LLC is somewhat smaller than <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> and is a hybrid in that it operates as an incumbent in rural markets and as a business services provider with its enterprise and wholesale units, which compete nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> have significantly larger scale, greater business diversification and also lower financial leverage as investment grade operators. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s EBITDA leverage is higher than <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>, but <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>'s rating is heavily influenced by declining revenue/EBITDA (whereas Frontier grew in recent periods) and liquidity risk given its current operating profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues are flat to modestly down in the next few years, with fiber growth offset by copper-based declines. Assumes modest revenue increases starting in 2026 as fiber becomes a bigger piece of mix. Assumes mid-single digit growth in data & internet services, offset by double-digit declines in Voice & Video;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins expand to low-40% over ratings horizon, benefiting from a mix shift to fiber (higher margin);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash Taxes and restructuring costs are a modest use of cash flow in the next few years, with taxes kept low due to operating losses and tax loss carryforwards;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex declines materially starting in 2025 as fiber spend slows;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage remains in the low/mid-5.0x range, or near current levels, over the ratings horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision. For more information on <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ESG Relevance Scores, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/topics/esg/products#esg-relevance-scores[https://www.fitchratings.com/topics/esg/products#esg-relevance-scores].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For entities rated 'B+' and below, where default is closer and recovery prospects are more meaningful to investors, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> undertakes a tailored, or bespoke, analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. The resulting debt instrument rating includes a Recovery Rating (RR, graded from 'RR1' to 'RR6'), and is notched from the IDR accordingly. In this analysis, there are three steps: (i) estimating the distressed enterprise value (EV); (ii) estimating creditor claims; and (iii) distribution of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> will emerge from a default scenario under the going concern approach versus liquidation. Key assumptions used in the recovery analysis are as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Going Concern (GC) EBITDA - <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a GC EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion, which is roughly 20% below the company's current run-rate EBITDA (less EBITDA from the Dallas metro area). Reduced EBITDA of this magnitude in a bankruptcy scenario could imply increased competition has pressured revenue to decline by 10%-20% and EBITDA margins have declined closer to 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> excludes from its recovery waterfall debt amounts outstanding at <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s issuer subsidiary for its Dallas securitization, Frontier Issuer LLC. This entity is a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes this entity would not be part of a corporate-level bankruptcy. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has, however, included residual cash flows (discounted for a stressed scenario) as part of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery EBITDA assumptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EV Multiple - <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a 5.5x multiple, using a blended approach of roughly 50% of business being copper-based (legacy) at 4.0x and 50% being fiber (growth) at 7.0x. This multiple is validated based upon historic industry trading multiples, M&A transactions in the industry, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> bankruptcy case studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage, defined as debt/EBITDA, sustained below 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue and/or EBITDA growth expected to be sustained at mid-single digit percentage or higher;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained positive FCF generation could also lead <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> to reassess the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to stabilization of the IDR:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained in the low- to mid-5.0x range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained EBITDA improvement in 2024-2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained above 5.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--More aggressive capital or financial policies that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as negative for the credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Profile: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> will have approximately $1.9 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments pro forma for the new term loan and recent ABS offering, as well as capacity on its $900 million revolving credit facility. Part of the revolver expires in April 2025, but $850 million of capacity could mature as late as 2028. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> to have material FCF deficits of more than $2.6 billion cumulatively in 2024-2025, a material portion of which could be funded through future debt issuance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Projected negative FCFs over <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ratings horizon are due to the capital-intensive nature of the business in conjunction with an aggressive build-out of fiber across its footprint. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> will be heavily reliant on the capital markets in the next few years for its liquidity needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Profile: Pro forma for the new TL and ABS raise, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has roughly $11.6 billion of debt outstanding as of March 2024 (excluding finance leases) and its debt structure consists of various sources of capital including: $2.3 billion of securitization debt that was raised in 2023-2024 (asset-backed debt collateralized by the company's Texas fiber footprint), roughly $5.7 billion of senior secured debt, $2.8 billion of second-lien debt and $750 million of unsecured subsidiary debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's first lien debt includes a $900 million senior secured revolving credit facility and $1.0 billion of term loans outstanding, pro forma for the refinanced TL. Nearly all of the company's debt matures between 2027-2031 and, thus, there is some maturity concentration risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is the fourth largest U.S. incumbent local exchange carrier providing data and Internet services (61% of 2023 revenue), wireline voice (24%), and wireline video service (7%) to residential and business customers. The company is publicly traded on Nasdaq (FYBR).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-07 February 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Parent, Inc.</span> (Frontier) and its rated subsidiaries' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to 'B+' from 'BB-'. The Rating Outlooks on these entities is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade and Outlook reflect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that continued fiber expansion in the next few years will require additional capital raises that will keep financial leverage high and free cash flow meaningfully negative over the ratings horizon. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the company will consider multiple avenues for future financing, and management is focused on its credit ratings over time, but its elevated leverage positions the IDR more appropriately at the 'B+' rating. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could stabilize the rating at 'B+' if the company displays continued EBITDA expansion in the next couple of years combined with EBITDA leverage sustained in the low- to mid-5.0x range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is encouraged by the progress <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has made to date building out its fiber network and improving EBITDA modestly for the YTD 2023 period through September and expects EBITDA could improve further in 2024-2025 as fiber grows in the revenue mix. However, there remains multiple years of heavy capital investment to achieve its 10 million fiber passings goal and increased leverage limits flexibility for execution risks or other challenges that could arise, particularly in what has become a tighter capital markets environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also downgraded to 'B+' and subsequently withdrawn the IDR for Frontier Southwest, Inc. given its debt was defeased with proceeds from the August 2023 fiber securitization transaction and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not expect the issuer will issue debt in the future. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also withdrawn the issue-level ratings at Frontier Southwest, Inc. on its outstanding senior notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Elevated Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates EBITDA leverage was in the mid-5.0x range at YE 2023 and could remain in the low- to mid-5.0x range through <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s forecast period. While EBITDA net leverage is lower in the mid-4.0x range inclusive of short-term investments, the company is aggressively spending on its fiber expansion strategy and so its sizable cash does not provide meaningful protection to repay existing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s financial leverage increased materially in 2022-2023 due to heavy capital spending to fund its fiber network deployment, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as carrying execution risk related to both subscriber adoption and build cost. The company has flexibility to adapt the pace of its capital spending, but this is somewhat constrained by the need to offset revenue erosion from its copper network and certain legacy services. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the company had material cash and short-term investments of more than $2.0 billion at YE 2023, which should enable much of its near-term fiber build plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Allocation: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s capital allocation policy following its April 2021 bankruptcy emergence largely centers on accelerated plans to invest in fiber to the home (FTTH) as well as to target fiber deployment to small and medium businesses, enterprises and the wholesale market. The company's financial policy targets net leverage in the mid-3x range, although it is above this range following the acceleration of its fiber build in 2022 (4.3x reported at September 2023).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive investment plan will expand the deployment of fiber to more than 10 million locations, or two-thirds of its current footprint. As of September 2023, the company has 6.2 million fiber passings and targets 10 million by YE 2025. Penetration rates on the base fiber network are 44%; penetration rates in new build areas are lower on average with a target penetration rate of 25%-30% after 24 months, but are expected to reach similar penetration to the base network over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fiber Opportunity Mitigates Risks: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views both opportunity and execution risk for <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> to grow its fiber-based revenue. Risks are somewhat mitigated by secular growth evidenced by success in adding fiber customers, with several years of consecutive quarters of net adds and lower churn (broadband fiber churn in 1.34%-1.36% range for consumer/business customers for YTD through September 2023 compared to ~1.9% for its copper customers). The opportunity to capture additional broadband share is highlighted by a footprint that has only one or no competitors in approximately 85% of its markets. The new locations to be served by fiber have material upside, as penetration rates for the company's legacy, less-competitive copper broadband network are in the low-teens percentage range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative Cash Flows: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views heavy capital intensity and cash burn related to its fiber build-out strategy as constraining the IDR in the next few years. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> calculates FCF deficits accelerated meaningfully in the past few years and could be near $1.9 billion in 2023 versus $1.3 billion (2022) and $900+ million (2021). Nearly all cash flow deterioration is from significantly increased capex spend of more than $3.0 billion in 2023 versus the low-$1.0 billion range in 2019-2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF deficits will continue in the next few years and make the company reliant on the capital markets to fund its fiber expansion strategy. The company has the ability to pull back on fiber spending/capex in order to manage its cash burn, but this would delay its targeted goal to reach 10 million fiber passings by YE 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Margins Improving: Accelerated fiber deployments are improving profitability, and the ongoing fiber mix shift could help drive further margin expansion over time. Reported EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points YoY for the YTD period through September 2023. Management guided margins could expand to the mid- to high-40% range over time (~39% YTD 2023), although <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates margin expanding only to low-40% by 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes fiber now comprises more than 60% of total EBITDA and the ongoing mix shift to fiber should help profitability, as fiber requires fewer on-site service calls versus copper and lower call volumes generally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additionally, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has been aggressively cutting costs and is believed to have cut more than $500 million from mid-2021 through YE 2023. Growing EBITDA combined with increased fiber penetration should enable the company to delever its balance sheet in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Competition Intense: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views competition in telecom services as intense and increasingly diverse as more providers and technology solutions have entered <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s end markets. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has a strong presence within its footprint, often only competing with one other wireline provider, but other providers have also been building out their own networks around the U.S. Cable companies, fiber "overbuilders", satellite providers, among others continually seek increased market share in broadband services. Additionally, U.S. wireless companies have now become a viable alternative internet solution with fixed wireless access given increased 5G speeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> links the IDRs of Frontier and its subsidiaries based on a strong parent/weak subsidiary approach. The IDRs are equalized under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s criteria based on an analysis incorporating high strategic and operational incentives and low legal incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> has higher exposure to the consumer market compared with wireline peer <span class="companylink">Lumen Technologies, Inc.</span> (CCC-/RWN), and Windstream Services, LLC (B/Stable). The consumer market faces secular challenges (particularly in voice/video), with legacy revenue declines in older copper-based communication technologies being only somewhat offset by growth in faster, fiber-based technology. Incumbent wireline operators face competition for broadband customers from cable operators, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp.</span> (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc.</span> (<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> rates Charter's indirect subsidiary <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> BB+/Stable).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> also faces emerging broadband competition from 5G wireless operators offering fixed wireless access, including T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc.</span> (A-/Stable). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s aggressive fiber investments as having long-term benefits but will require significant near-term costs that will weigh on cash flow generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is less competitive in the enterprise market, although its enterprise business has some differences compared to larger peers as it is less exposed to large enterprise accounts. In enterprise, <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc.</span> (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> and <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>. All three companies have an advantage as national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Windstream Services, LLC is somewhat smaller than <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> and is a hybrid in that it operates as an incumbent in rural markets and as a business services provider with its enterprise and wholesale units, which compete nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> have significantly larger scale, greater business diversification and also meaningfully lower financial leverage as investment grade operators. <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s EBITDA leverage is higher than <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>, but <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>'s rating is heavily influenced currently by a transaction support agreement (TSA) the company entered into in late 2023/early 2024 that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as potentially drawing the issuer toward a distressed debt exchange (DDE). Frontier also recently exhibited EBITDA growth whereas <span class="companylink">Lumen</span>'s revenue/EBITDA continue to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues are flat to modestly down in the next few years, with fiber growth offset by copper-based declines. Assumes modest revenue increases starting in 2026 as fiber becomes a bigger piece of mix. Assumes mid-single digit growth in data & internet services, offset by double-digit declines in Voice & Video;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margins expand to low-40% over ratings horizon, benefiting from a mix shift to fiber (higher margin);</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash Taxes and restructuring costs - modest use of cash flow in the next few years, with taxes kept low due to operating losses and tax loss carryforwards;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex declines materially starting in 2025 as fiber spend slows;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage remains in the low/mid-5.0x range, or near current levels, over the ratings horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For entities rated 'B+' and below - where default is closer and recovery prospects are more meaningful to investors - <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> undertakes a tailored, or bespoke, analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. The resulting debt instrument rating includes a Recovery Rating (RR, graded from 'RR1' to 'RR6'), and is notched from the IDR accordingly. In this analysis, there are three steps: (i) estimating the distressed enterprise value (EV); (ii) estimating creditor claims; and (iii) distribution of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> will emerge from a default scenario under the going concern approach versus liquidation. Key assumptions used in the recovery analysis are as follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Going Concern (GC) EBITDA - <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a GC EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion, which is roughly 20% below the company's current run-rate EBITDA (less EBITDA from the Dallas metro area). Reduced EBITDA of this magnitude in a bankruptcy scenario could imply increased competition has pressured revenue to decline by 10-20% and EBITDA margins have declined closer to 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">Fitch</span> excludes from its recovery waterfall debt amounts outstanding at <span class="companylink">Frontier</span>'s issuer subsidiary for its Dallas securitization, Frontier Issuer LLC. This entity is a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes this entity would not be part of a corporate-level bankruptcy. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has, however, included residual cash flows (discounted for a stressed scenario) as part of <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s recovery EBITDA assumptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EV Multiple - <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a 5.5x multiple, using a blended approach of roughly 50% of business being copper-based (legacy) at 4.0x and 50% being fiber (growth) at 7.0x. This multiple is validated based upon historic industry trading multiples, M&A transactions in the industry, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> bankruptcy case studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage, defined as debt/EBITDA, sustained below 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue and/or EBITDA growth expected to be sustained at mid-single digit percentage or higher;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained positive FCF generation could also lead <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> to reassess the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to stabilization of the IDR:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained in the low- to mid-5.0x range;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained EBITDA improvement in 2024-2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA leverage sustained above 5.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--More aggressive capital or financial policies that <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views as negative for the credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity Profile: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> had approximately $2.2 billion of unrestricted cash and short-term investments at September 2023, as well as $651 million available on its $900 million revolving credit facility. The revolver expires in April 2025, but $850 million of capacity could mature as late as 2028. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> to have material FCF deficits of more than $2.6 billion cumulatively in 2024-2025, a meaningful portion of which could be funded through future debt issuance. Projected negative FCFs over <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ratings horizon are due to the capital-intensive nature of the business in conjunction with an aggressive build-out of fiber across its footprint. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> will be heavily reliant on the capital markets in the next few years for its liquidity needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Profile: <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> had roughly $11.2 billion of debt outstanding as of September 2023 and its debt structure consists of various sources of capital including: $1.6 billion of securitization debt that was raised in 2023 (asset-backed debt collateralized by the company's Dallas metro area fiber footprint), roughly $6.1 billion of senior secured debt, $2.8 billion of second-lien debt and $750 million of unsecured subsidiary debt. Its first lien debt includes a $900 million senior secured revolving credit facility and $1.4 billion of term loans outstanding. The company also has capacity under a $500 million securitized financing facility entered into at the time of the Dallas market fiber securitization. Nearly all of the company's debt matures between 2027-2031 and, thus, there is some maturity concentration risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Frontier</span> is the fourth largest U.S. incumbent local exchange carrier providing data and Internet services (58% of 2022 revenue), wireline voice (26%), and wireline video service (9%) to residential and business customers. The company is expected to generate 2023 revenue of roughly $5.8 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-30 April 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to <b>Frontier Communications</b> Holdings, LLC (Delaware) and its subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook. Frontier assumed the debt of <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Corporation</span> (Corp) at the latter's emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021. Through the completion of restructuring transactions, Corp's direct, first-tier subsidiaries and other directly held assets were transferred to Frontier. Following the satisfaction of the pre-petition senior unsecured noteholders' claims, Corp will dissolve and cease to exist as a legal entity. Fitch has withdrawn Corp's 'BB-(EXP)' IDR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has assigned a 'BB+'/'RR2' rating to Frontier's senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility, term loan and notes. The company's senior secured second-lien notes have been assigned a 'BB-'/'RR4' rating. Fitch's "Corporates Recovery Ratings and Instrument Ratings Criteria" was updated on April 9, 2021, leading to the change in the Recovery Ratings on the first-lien debt, and the ratings and Recovery Ratings for the second-lien debt and certain subsidiary unsecured debt from the prior Expected ratings. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1' rating assigned to Corp's $1.25 billion first-lien term loan has been withdrawn as the first-lien term loan facility was assumed by Frontier at emergence and upsized to $1.475 billion and has been assigned a 'BB+'/'RR2' rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Leverage Upon Emergence from Bankruptcy: Frontier's 'BB-' IDR and Stable Outlook is supported by relatively low leverage for the rating and relatively low leverage compared with other telecom operators in Fitch's U.S. telecom universe. Fitch expects gross leverage of 2.9x at YE 2021 and net leverage of 2.3x. With much lower rural broadband support in 2022, gross leverage could rise by approximately 0.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Following emergence, Frontier's cash generation will improve materially following a reduction in interest expense of more than $1 billion annually. Fitch believes the company will have the opportunity to increase investments in key strategic areas, including fiber to the home and greater fiber investment to support enterprise and wholesale services, including fiber to the tower. The rating is constrained by the near-term expected decline in legacy revenues and the need to continue to take costs out of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Allocation: Frontier emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2021. The current holders of the senior unsecured debt have become the new owners of the company as a result of the plan of reorganization. The capital-allocation policy remains uncertain as the new board of directors will be installed upon the emergence from bankruptcy. The new board may consider more aggressive investment plans, as well as more fully articulate capital structure policies. The company and parties to the restructuring support agreement RSA targeted a relatively low net leverage ratio of less than 3.0x based on the level of debt at emergence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Operating Environment: The rating incorporates a challenging operating environment for wireline operators. Fitch expects Frontier's revenue trends to remain negative in the next couple of years on an organic basis. The expiration of Connect America Fund II (CAF II) funding at the end of 2021 will affect the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects this latter effect to be mitigated by the next generation of broadband support through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). Fitch's updated assumptions include $37 million annually won in the RDOF auction. Fitch's prior assumptions excluded any potential funding from this program. The de-emphasis of products, such as certain video offerings, will affect revenues but will have a far lower effect on EBITDA margins given programming cost offsets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF and Debt: Fitch estimates FCF will be around $300 million-$400 million in 2021. FCF is expected to be pressured in 2022 due to the expiration of CAF II funding and the potential for increasing capital spending on fiber investments. The effect on FCF due to the expiration of CAF II funding is mitigated by additional broadband funding support. Following the emergence from bankruptcy, Frontier will have a much more tenable capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset Sales: In May 2020, Frontier sold operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana -- the Northwest operations -- to WaveDivision Capital, LLC for $1.35 billion in cash. This cash, combined with existing cash, is being used to settle claims in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Secured Debt Notching: For rated entities with IDRs of 'BB-' or above, Fitch does not perform a bespoke analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. Instead, Fitch uses notching guidance whereby an issuer's first-lien secured debt can be notched upward one or to two rating levels. Frontier parent secured first-lien debt is notched up two levels from the Long-Term IDR to 'BB+'/'RR2'. The recovery is limited to 'RR2' given the first-lien debt is primarily secured by equity pledges and there is material subsidiary-level debt. The first mortgage bonds of Frontier Southwest Inc. are also notched up two levels from the IDR to 'BB+'/'RR1', the security provided by a first lien on substantially all of its assets supporting the 'RR1' recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Nonfirst-Lien Debt Notching: For corporate entities rated 'BB-' and above, the ratings assigned to an issuer's nonfirst-lien debt (second lien, unsecured and subordinated debt) are capped at 'RR4' and there is no notching above the IDR. This leads to 'BB-'/'RR4' ratings for Frontier's second-lien debt and subsidiary unsecured debt, except for Frontier Florida LLC. The 'B+'/'RR5' rating assigned to Frontier Florida's unsecured debt reflects that Frontier Florida is a guarantor of Frontier's secured credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Fitch linked Frontier's IDRs to its operating subsidiaries based on strong operational ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a higher exposure to the more volatile residential market compared with wireline peer <span class="companylink">Lumen Technologies, Inc</span>. (BB/Stable), and to some extent Windstream Services, LLC (not rated by Fitch). Incumbent wireline operators within the residential market face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> BB+/Stable). Cheaper alternative offerings, such as voice over internet protocol and over-the-top video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline operators had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier needs to improve its competitive position in the enterprise market. In this market, Frontier is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (BBB+/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. (A-/Stable) and Lumen. All three companies have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with Frontier, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Fitch expects Frontier's gross leverage to be slightly lower than <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon follow its emergence from bankruptcy and the two larger operators large C-Band spectrum investments made in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues decline just above 10% in 2021, reflecting the sale of the Pacific Northwest properties on May 1, 2020 and secular effects. Revenue declines in 2022 due to the loss of CAF II revenues in 2022. Revenue declines slow as the company continues to focus on fiber and increasing fiber broadband penetration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The EBITDA margin declines from the high 30% range in 2020 and 2021 to the mid-30% range in 2022. The loss of CAF II funding further lowers EBITDA margins in 2022. Pressure in 2022 is partly offset by new rural broadband subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending reflects company plans of approximately $1.2 billion in 2021. Capital intensity increases thereafter as the company focuses on its longer term modernization plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash taxes are nominal in 2021-2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross leverage, defined as total debt with equity credit/operating EBITDA, expected to be sustained at or below 3.0x, with FFO leverage of 3.0x, while consistently generating positive FCF margins in the midsingle digits;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater certainty around the company's capital allocation given the new shareholder base upon emergence;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Successful execution on cost-reduction plans;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent gains in revenues from anticipated investments in fiber and broadband product areas;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating stable EBITDA and FCF growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier ended 2020 with a substantial amount of liquidity, with $1.829 billion of unrestricted cash. At emergence, the company distributed approximately $1.3 billion of the cash balance to the pre-petition senior unsecured noteholders. Cash balances will also include approximately $225 million from an incremental exit term loan facility. The incremental term loan, plus an undrawn $625 million credit facility, will provide the company with $850 million of liquidity as required under the plan of reorganization, and total liquidity of more than $1.2 billion. First-lien debt totals approximately $4.2 billion, second-lien debt totals $1.75 billion and subsidiary debt totals $856 million. The second-lien debt amount includes $750 million of second-lien takeback debt. Other than the revolver maturity in 2025, there are no major maturities until 2027.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has revised Frontier's ESG Relevance Score for Management Strategy to '3' from '4'. The score of '4' was related to operational challenges following the close of the Verizon transaction in 2016 that resulted in elevated subscriber churn and weaker than expected revenue, which had a negative impact on the credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-19 November 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Corp</span>.'s proposed $1.8 billion first lien senior secured exit notes due 2028, and a 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1' rating to the proposed offering of $1 billion of second lien senior secured exit notes due 2029. Net proceeds from the note offerings, together with the proceeds from an incremental term loan DIP-to-exit facility, and cash on hand, will be used to repay in full the outstanding prepetition second lien notes in the amount of $1.6 billion, and the prepetition first lien term loan B in the amount of $1.7 billion, as well as related interest, fees and expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BB-(EXP)'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects to assign the ratings following Frontier's emergence from bankruptcy in early 2021. The expected ratings will be reviewed for material changes prior to Fitch assigning final ratings. Material changes may include changes in the company's capital structure at emergence, any material deviations from current assumptions, and Fitch's issuance of updated criteria or criteria exposure drafts. Expected ratings, similar to any other rating, can be upgraded, downgraded, placed on Rating Watch or withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Leverage Upon Emergence from Bankruptcy: Frontier's 'BB-(EXP)' and Stable Outlook is supported by relatively low leverage for the rating and relatively low leverage compared with other telecom operators in Fitch's U.S. telecom universe. Fitch expects gross leverage of 2.8x at YE 2021 and net leverage of 2.4x. Absent additional rural broadband support, leverage, both gross and net, could rise to 0.4x to 0.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A much improved FCF position will result from a reduction in interest expense of more than $1 billion annually. Fitch believes the company will have the opportunity to increase investments in key strategic areas, including fiber to the home and greater fiber investment to support enterprise and wholesale services, including fiber to the tower. The rating is constrained by the near-term expected decline in legacy revenues and the need to continue to take costs out of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Managing Coronavirus Effects: Fitch believes the risk of the coronavirus pandemic on the operational performance of the telecom sector is low relative to other sectors. Enterprise revenues have some pressure with businesses temporarily closed with the effect on small businesses more pronounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This was mitigated by increased use in communication services to conduct business as travel is down materially and remote working continues. Stability in consumer revenues is supported by demand for broadband, not only for work-at-home, but remote learning and increased consumption of entertainment services, such as video and gaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Allocation: Frontier is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in early 2021. The current holders of the senior unsecured debt will become the new owners of the company as a result of the restructuring support agreement (RSA). The capital allocation policy remains uncertain while the company is in bankruptcy, with respect to more aggressive investment plans, and an articulated capital structure. Fitch believes the company and parties to the RSA are targeting a net leverage ratio of less than 3.0x based on the anticipated level of debt at emergence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Operating Environment: The rating incorporates a challenging operating environment for wireline operators. Fitch expects Frontier's revenue trends remain negative in the next couple of years on an organic basis. The expiration of CAF II funding in 2022 will affect the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects this latter effect to be mitigated by the next generation of broadband support through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, although Fitch's assumptions exclude potential funding from this program. The de-emphasis of products, such as video, will affect revenues but will have a far lower effect on EBITDA margins, given programming cost offsets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF and Debt: Fitch is estimating FCF will be around $500 million in 2021, when the company is expected to emerge from bankruptcy. FCF could decline to around $250 million to $300 million in 2022 upon the expiration of CAF II funding. The effect on FCF due to the expiration of CAF II funding could be mitigated by additional broadband funding support. Following the emergence from bankruptcy, Frontier will have a much more tenable capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset Sales: Frontier sold operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, the Northwest operations, to WaveDivision Capital, LLC for $1.35 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments. This cash, combined with existing cash, will be used to settle claims in bankruptcy. Fitch estimated the transaction multiple was approximately 5.3x based on 2019 estimated EBITDA. Fitch-calculated EBITDA is before restructuring, other charges and a goodwill impairment for operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Secured Debt Notching: Frontier parent secured debt is notched up two levels from the Long-Term IDR. The secured debt benefits from certain guarantees and equity pledges. The first mortgage bonds of Frontier Southwest are also notched up two levels from the IDR, given the security provided by a first lien on substantially all of its assets. For rated entities with IDRs of 'BB-' or above, Fitch does not perform a bespoke analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. Instead, Fitch uses notching guidance whereby an issuer's secured debt can be notched upward zero to two rating levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unsecured Debt Notching: For corporate entities rated 'BB-' and above, the rating assigned to an issuer's senior unsecured debt instrument assumes an average recovery available for these creditors in the event of bankruptcy. When average recovery prospects are present, IDRs and unsecured debt instrument ratings are equal, with no notching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For subsidiary unsecured debt, Fitch notes the structural seniority to Frontier parent debt, and the rating is notched up one level to 'BB(EXP)'/'RR2'. At any rating level where the bespoke approach is not used, analysts can denote contractual or structural subordination that is detrimental to the unsecured debt by rating it lower than the IDR. A bespoke style analysis determining below average recoveries could lead to a rating lower than the IDR. The 'B+(EXP)'/'RR5' rating assigned to Frontier Florida's unsecured debt reflects that Frontier Florida is a guarantor of Frontier's secured credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Fitch linked Frontier's IDRs to its operating subsidiaries based on strong operational ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has higher exposure to the more volatile residential market compared with <span class="companylink">CenturyLink, Inc</span>. (BB/Stable), a wireline peer, and to some extent, Windstream Services, LLC. Incumbent wireline operators within the residential market face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators, such as <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>(BB+/Stable).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cheaper alternative offerings, such as voice over internet protocol and over-the-top video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline operators had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. Fitch expects Frontier to emerge from bankruptcy with lower leverage than higher-rated peers CenturyLink and Charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier needs to improve its competitive position in the enterprise market. In this market, Frontier is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. (A-/Stable) and CenturyLink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >All three companies have an advantage with national or multinational companies, given extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Frontier has a slightly smaller enterprise business than wireline peer Windstream. Compared with Frontier, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon, have wireless offerings providing more service diversification. Frontier's gross leverage is expected to be slightly higher than <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon following emergence from bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues decline just above 10% in 2020, largely reflecting the sale of the Pacific Northwest properties on May 1, 2020;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue declines at a slightly lower rate in 2021 and 2022, due to the partial year of the Northwest assets in 2020, and the loss of CAF II revenues, respectively;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA margin is expected to decline to the high 30% range in 2020 and 2021 from the low 40% range in 2019. The loss of CAF II funding further lowers EBTIDA margins in 2022.Pressure in 2022 could be partly offset by future rural broadband subsidies;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending reflects company plans of approximately $1.3 billion in 2020. Thereafter, capital intensity ranges from 16% to 18%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash taxes are nominal in 2020-2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross leverage, defined as total debt with equity credit/operating EBITDA, expected to be sustained at or below 3.0x, with FFO leverage of 3.0x, while consistently generating positive FCF margins in the mid-single digits;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater certainty around capital allocation, given the new shareholder base upon emergence from bankruptcy;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Successful execution on cost reduction plans;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent gains in revenues from anticipated investments in fiber/broadband product areas;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating stable EBITDA and FCF growth;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating EBITDA margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Discretionary management decisions, including but not limited to, execution of M&A activity that increases gross leverage beyond 4.5x, with FFO leverage of 4.5x, in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a substantial amount of liquidity at this current point-in-time with more than$1.7 billion of unrestricted cash. At emergence, the company expects to have $150 million of unrestricted cash and an undrawn $625 million credit facility. First-lien debt is expected to be $3.96 billion, second-lien debt is expected to total $1 billion, and subsidiary debt is expected to total $856 million. Parent takeback debt is expected to be $750 million, and whether or not it is secured or unsecured will be determined at emergence. Fitch expects to provide a final rating on the takeback debt at that time.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-16 November 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the 'BB-(EXP)' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Corp</span>. (Frontier, OTC: FTRCQ) and its subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has also affirmed Frontier's $625 million first lien secured exit revolver due 2024 at 'BB+ (EXP)'/'RR1', the $1.7 billion pre-petition first lien secured term loan due 2024 at 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1', the $1.15 billion first lien exit notes due 2027 at 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1' and the $1.6 billion pre-petition second lien secured notes due 2026 at 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, Fitch has affirmed the first lien secured term loan exit facility due 2027 at 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1'; Frontier plans to increase the size of this exit facility from its existing $500 million to $1 billion, with proceeds expected to be used to repay a portion of the $1.7 billion prepetition first lien term loan due 2024. In addition, Fitch expects the remainder of the $1.7 billion first lien term loan and the entire $1.6 billion pre-petition second lien notes to be refinanced with other secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier's and Frontier Southwest Inc.'s senior secured debt is affirmed at 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1'. The senior unsecured debt of Frontier North Inc., Frontier California Inc. and <span class="companylink">Frontier West Virginia Inc</span>. is affirmed at 'BB(EXP)'/'RR2'. The senior unsecured debt of Frontier Florida LLC is affirmed at 'B+(EXP)'/'RR5'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects to assign the ratings following Frontier's emergence in early 2021. The expected ratings will be reviewed for material changes prior to Fitch assigning final ratings. Material changes may include changes in the company's capital structure at emergence, any material deviations from current assumptions, and Fitch's issuance of updated criteria or criteria exposure drafts. Expected ratings, similar to any other rating, can be raised, lowered, placed on Rating Watch or withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Leverage Upon Emergence: Frontier's 'BB-(EXP)' and Stable Outlook is supported by relatively low leverage for the rating and relatively low leverage compared with other telecom operators in Fitch's U.S. telecom universe. We expect gross leverage of 2.8x at YE 2021 and net leverage of 2.4x. Absent additional rural broadband support, leverage, both gross and net, could rise to 0.4x to 0.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A much improved FCF position will result from a reduction in interest expense of more than $1 billion annually. Fitch believes the company will have the opportunity to increase investments in key strategic areas including fiber to the home and greater fiber investment to support enterprise and wholesale services, including fiber to the tower. The rating is constrained by the near-term expected decline in legacy revenues and the need to continue to take costs out of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Managing Coronavirus Effects: Fitch believes the risk of the coronavirus pandemic on the operational performance of the telecom sector is low relative to other sectors. Enterprise revenues have some pressure with businesses temporarily closed with the effect on small businesses more pronounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This was mitigated by increased use in communication services to conduct business as travel is down materially and remote working continues. Stability in consumer revenues is supported by demand for broadband, not only for work-at-home, but remote learning and increased consumption of entertainment services, such as video and gaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Allocation: Frontier is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in early 2021. The current holders of the senior unsecured debt will become the new owners of the company as a result of the restructuring support agreement (RSA). The capital allocation policy remains uncertain, while the company is in bankruptcy with respect to more aggressive investment plans and an articulated capital structure. Fitch believes the company and parties to the RSA are targeting a net leverage ratio of less than 3.0x based upon the anticipated level of debt at emergence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Operating Environment: The rating incorporates a challenging operating environment for wireline operators. We expect Frontier's revenue trends to continue to be negative in the next couple of years on an organic basis. The expiration of CAF II funding in 2022 will affect the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects this latter effect to be mitigated by the next generation of broadband support through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, although our assumptions exclude potential funding from this program. The de-emphasis of products, such as video, will affect revenues but will have a far lower effect on EBITDA margins, given programming cost offsets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF and Debt: Fitch is estimating FCF will be around $500 million in 2021, when the company is expected to emerge from bankruptcy. FCF could decline to around $250 million to $300 million in 2022 upon the expiration of CAF II funding. The effect on FCF due to the expiration of CAF II funding could be mitigated by additional broadband funding support. Following the emergence from bankruptcy, Frontier will have a much more tenable capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset Sales: Frontier sold operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, the Northwest operations, to WaveDivision Capital, LLC for $1.35 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments. This cash, combined with existing cash, will be used to settle claims in bankruptcy. Fitch estimated the transaction multiple was approximately 5.3x based on 2019 estimated EBITDA. Fitch-calculated EBITDA is before restructuring, other charges and a goodwill impairment for operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Secured Debt Notching: Frontier parent secured debt is notched up two levels from the IDR. The secured debt benefits from certain guarantees and equity pledges. The first mortgage bonds of Frontier Southwest are also notched up two levels from the IDR, given the security provided by a first lien on substantially all of its assets. For rated entities with IDRs of 'BB-' or above, Fitch does not perform a bespoke analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. Instead, we use notching guidance whereby an issuer's secured debt can be notched upward zero to two rating levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unsecured Debt Notching: For corporate entities rated 'BB-' and above, the rating assigned to an issuer's senior unsecured debt instrument assumes an average recovery available to these creditors in the event of bankruptcy. When average recovery prospects are present, IDRs and unsecured debt instrument ratings are equal, with no notching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For subsidiary unsecured debt, Fitch notes the structural seniority to Frontier parent debt and the rating is notched up one level to 'BB(EXP)'/'RR2'. At any rating level where the bespoke approach is not used, analysts can denote contractual or structural subordination that is detrimental to the unsecured debt by rating it lower than the IDR. A bespoke style analysis determining below average recoveries could lead to a rating lower than the IDR. The 'B+(EXP)'/'RR5' assigned to Frontier Florida's unsecured debt reflects Frontier Florida as a guarantor of Frontier's secured credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Fitch linked the IDRs of Frontier and its operating subsidiaries based on strong operational ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has higher exposure to the more volatile residential market compared with <span class="companylink">CenturyLink, Inc</span>. (BB/Stable), a wireline peer, and to some extent, Windstream Services, LLC. Incumbent wireline operators within the residential market face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators, such as <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> (BB+/Stable).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cheaper alternative offerings, such as voice over internet protocol and over-the-top video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline operators had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. Fitch expects Frontier to emerge from bankruptcy with lower leverage than higher-rated peers CenturyLink and Charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier needs to improve its competitive position in the enterprise market. In this market, Frontier is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. (A-/Stable) and CenturyLink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >All three companies have an advantage with national or multinational companies, given extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Frontier has a slightly smaller enterprise business than wireline peer Windstream. Compared with Frontier, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon, have wireless offerings providing more service diversification. Frontier's gross leverage is expected to be slightly higher than <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon following emergence from bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Revenues decline just above 10% in 2020, largely reflecting the sale of the Pacific Northwest properties on May 1, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Revenue declines at a slightly lower rate in 2021 and 2022, due to the partial year of the Northwest assets in 2020, and the loss of CAF II revenues, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-EBITDA margin is expected to decline to the high 30% range in 2020 and 2021 from the low 40% range in 2019. The loss of CAF II funding further lowers EBTIDA margins in 2022. Pressure in 2022 could be partly offset by future rural broadband subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Capital spending reflects company plans of approximately $1.3 billion in 2020. Thereafter, capital intensity ranges from 16% to 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Cash taxes are nominal in 2020-2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross leverage, defined as total debt with equity credit/operating EBITDA, expected to be sustained at or below 3.0x, with FFO leverage of 3.0x, while consistently generating positive FCF margins in the mid-single-digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater certainty around capital allocation, given the new shareholder base upon emergence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Successful execution on cost reduction plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent gains in revenues from anticipated investments in fiber/broadband product areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating stable EBITDA and FCF growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating EBITDA margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Discretionary management decisions, including but not limited to, execution of M&A activity that increases gross leverage beyond 4.5x, with FFO leverage of 4.5x, in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a substantial amount of liquidity at this current point-in-time with more than $1.7 billion of unrestricted cash. At emergence, the company expects to have $150 million of unrestricted cash and an undrawn $625 million credit facility. First-lien debt is expected to be $3.96 billion, second-lien debt is expected to total $1 billion, and subsidiary debt is expected to total $856 million. Parent takeback debt is expected to be $750 million, and whether or not it is secured or unsecured will be determined at emergence. Fitch expects to provide a final rating on the takeback debt at that time.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-28 September 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BB+' new issue rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Corp</span>. (Frontier, NYSE: FTR) $1.65 billion of senior secured Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) financing in the form of a DIP-to-exit term loan and/or notes. The initial form will be as DIP facility/notes to be funded while the company is in bankruptcy. While in bankruptcy, the loan/notes will have a super priority administrative claim. Once Frontier emerges from bankruptcy, the DIP loan/notes will convert to first lien senior secured term loan and notes that will be pari passu with the company's reinstated first lien senior secured debt and first lien revolver. The DIP rating is assigned only with respect to the facility as it exists during the pendency of the bankruptcy. The post-emergence exit facility will have a distinct rating predicated on the reorganized debtors' new capital structure and with typical notching off of the Issuer Default Rating (IDR).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Under Fitch's criteria, DIP instrument ratings are point in time and accordingly, this issue rating will be withdrawn within one business day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Criteria Variation: In the analysis of the Frontier DIP, we have considered both loan and bond components as being akin to a loan for the various considerations described in the criteria because the bonds and the loans components will share the same collateral, have identical provisions and the distinction in debt form (loan vs bond) does not impact the relative risk. The variation did not lead to a category level rating change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has also assigned a 'BB-(EXP)' Long-Term IDR to Frontier and its subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook. In addition, Fitch has assigned expected instrument ratings based on the capital structure outlined in 'Liquidity and Debt Structure'. Frontier's and Frontier Southwest's senior secured debt have been assigned a 'BB+(EXP)'/'RR1' ratings. The senior unsecured debt of Frontier North, Frontier California and <span class="companylink">Frontier West Virginia</span> has been assigned a 'BB(EXP)'/'RR2' rating. The senior unsecured debt of Frontier Florida has been assigned a 'B+(EXP)'/'RR5' rating. Fitch expects to assign the ratings following Frontier's emergence in early 2021. The expected ratings will be reviewed for material changes prior to Fitch assigning final ratings. Material changes may include changes in the company's capital structure at emergence, any material deviations from current assumptions, as well as Fitch's issuance of updated criteria or criteria exposure draft. Expected ratings, like any other rating, can be raised, lowered, placed on Rating Watch or withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >DIP Key Rating Drivers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collateral Value to DIP Loan/Notes: The overcollateralization of the DIP facility/notes is the most important rating driver and carries significant weight in the issue rating. Although substantially all value is pledged to the DIP lenders, the majority of the actual collateral is limited to equity interest in certain subsidiaries. The enterprise valuation underlying the confirmed plan of reorganization equals $11.25 billion of which approximately $10.8 billion is included in the DIP collateral package. Fitch forecasted EBITDA for 2020 and 2021 is $2.38 billion and $2.04 billion, respectively (net of CAF II funding), reflecting a bankruptcy multiple of approximately 5x. The multiple is supported by peer trading multiples and purchase multiples in sector M&A transactions. Structurally senior debt at the subsidiary level as well as the equally ranking DIP revolving facility eat into the DIP term loan collateral cushion. Incurrence of incremental term loan debt and/or additional subsidiary level debt could further reduce collateral coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Facility Structural Attributes: Structural features of the DIP agreement are another key rating driver. Certain structural features of the DIP facility/notes terms were considered to be protective of lenders, including its priming first lien, super-priority administrative ranking and the inclusion of subsidiary guarantees. However, lender control over the bankruptcy process is limited due to the absence of maintenance financial covenants and case milestones. The limitation of collateral to equity interests in subsidiaries is less protective and can give rise to additional structurally senior or structurally pari debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Post-Petition Liquidity and Cash Flow: The $1.650 billion DIP facility/notes are being used entirely to refinance outstanding first lien bonds and provides no additional liquidity. However, Fitch anticipates the core business to produce modestly positive FCF on a go forward basis (Fitch estimates around $500 million in 2021, declining to $250 million to $300 million in 2022 when CAF II funding expires and prior to any replacement funding). Furthermore, Frontier has robust cash reserves as a result of several asset sales executed during the pendency of the bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Prospects and Restructuring Scope: The DIP-to-Exit facility/notes executed post-confirmation is unique and alleviates a substantial amount of risk typically associated with the bankruptcy process. Fitch anticipates the company will emerge as a going-concern and continue to operate. Although a somewhat lengthy regulatory approval process will likely delay emergence until early 2021, the confirmation of the plan signals the conclusion of the debtor/creditor negotiation phase and emergence is expected to occur in due course. Upon emergence, Frontier will have a significantly improved balance sheet and financial profile with debt reduced by approximately $11 billion+ and interest expense reduced by $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Expected Rating Key Rating Drivers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Leverage upon Emergence: The 'BB-(EXP)' IDR and Stable Outlook is supported by relatively low leverage for the IDR and relatively low leverage compared with other telecom operators in Fitch's U.S. telecom universe. Fitch expects gross leverage of 2.8x at YE 2021 (net leverage of 2.4x). In the absence of additional rural broadband support, leverage, both gross and net, could rise approximately 0.4x to 0.5x. Additionally, a much improved FCF position will result with a reduction in interest expense of more than $1 billion annually. Fitch believes the company will have the opportunity to increase investments in key strategic areas including fiber to the home, and greater fiber investment to support enterprise and wholesale services, including fiber to the tower. The rating is constrained by the near-term expected decline in legacy revenues and the need to continue to take costs out of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Managing Impact of Coronavirus: Fitch believes the risk of the pandemic on the operational performance of the telecom sector is low relative to other sectors. Enterprise revenues have some pressure with businesses temporarily closed (with the effect on small businesses more pronounced), but this has been mitigated by increased use in communication services to conduct business as travel is down materially and remote working continues. Stability in consumer revenues has been supported by demand for broadband, not only for work at home, but remote learning and increased consumption of entertainment services such as video and gaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capital Allocation: Frontier is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in early 2021. The current holders of senior unsecured debt will become the new owners of the company as a result of the restructuring support agreement. The company's capital allocation policy remains uncertain while the company is in bankruptcy with respect to more aggressive investment plans and an articulated capital structure. Fitch believes the company and parties to the restructuring support agreement are targeting a net leverage ratio of less than three times based upon the anticipated level of debt at emergence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Operating Environment: Frontier's rating incorporates a challenging operating environment for wireline operators. Fitch expects Frontier's revenue trends to continue to be negative in the next couple of years on an organic basis. The expiration of CAF II funding in 2022 will also have an impact on the company. Fitch expects this latter effect to be mitigated by the next generation of broadband support through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, although Fitch's assumptions exclude potential funding from this program. Additionally, the de-emphasis of products such as video will impact revenues but have a far lower impact on EBITDA margins given programming cost offsets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF and Debt: Fitch is estimating FCF will be around $500 million in 2021, when it is expected to emerge from bankruptcy. FCF could decline to around $250 million to $300 million in 2022 upon the expiration of CAF II funding. The effect on FCF due to the expiration of CAF II funding could be mitigated by additional broadband funding support. Following the emergence from bankruptcy, Frontier will have a much more tenable capital structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset Sale: Frontier sold its operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana (the Northwest operations) to WaveDivision Capital, LLC (WDC) for $1.352 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments. This cash combined with existing cash will be used to settle claims in the bankruptcy process. Fitch estimated the transaction multiple was approximately 5.3x based on 2019 estimated EBITDA (Fitch-calculated EBITDA is before restructuring and other charges and a goodwill impairment) for the operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Secured Debt Notching: Frontier parent secured debt is notched up two levels from the IDR. The secured debt benefits from certain guarantees and equity pledges. The first mortgage bonds of Frontier Southwest are also notched up two levels from the IDR given the security provided by a first lien on substantially all of its assets. For rated entities with IDRs of 'BB-' or above, Fitch does not perform a bespoke analysis of recovery upon default for each issuance. Instead, Fitch uses notching guidance whereby an issuer's secured debt can be notched by up to tow rating levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unsecured Debt Notching: For corporate entities rated 'BB-' and above, the rating assigned to an issuer's senior unsecured debt instrument assumes an average recovery available to these creditors in the event of bankruptcy. When average recovery prospects are present, IDRs and unsecured debt instrument ratings are equal, with no notching. For subsidiary unsecured debt, Fitch notes the structural seniority to Frontier parent debt and the rating is notched up one level to 'BB(EXP)'/'RR2'. At any rating level where the bespoke approach is not used, analysts can denote contractual or structural subordination that is detrimental to the unsecured debt by rating it lower than the IDR; additionally, a bespoke style analysis determining below average recoveries could also lead to a rating lower than the IDR. The 'B+(EXP)'/'RR5' Recovery Rating assigned to Frontier Florida's unsecured debt reflects Frontier Florida as a guarantor of Frontier's secured credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Fitch linked the IDRs of Frontier and its operating subsidiaries based on their strong operational ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a higher exposure to the more volatile residential market compared with <span class="companylink">CenturyLink, Inc</span>. (BB/Stable), one of its wireline peers, and to some extent, Windstream Services, LLC (not rated by Fitch). Incumbent wireline operators within the residential market face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> BB+/Stable.) Cheaper alternative offerings, such as voice over internet protocol and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline operators had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects the company to emerge from bankruptcy with lower leverage than its higher rated peers CenturyLink and Charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier needs to improve its competitive position in the enterprise market. In this market, Frontier is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. (A-/Stable) and CenturyLink. All three companies have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Frontier also has a slightly smaller enterprise business than its wireline peer Windstream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with Frontier, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon, have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Frontier's gross leverage is expected to be slightly higher than <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon follow its emergence from bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The maximum DIP size is $1.65 billion as split between the term loan and notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The final DIP order and DIP documentation is generally consistent with the terms provided in the term sheet and DIP motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenues decline just above 10% in 2020, largely reflecting the sale of the Pacific Northwest properties on May 1, 2020. Revenue declines at a slightly lower rate in 2021 and 2022, due to the partial year of the NW assets in 2020, and the loss of CAF II revenues, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The EBITDA margin is expected to decline to the high 30% range in 2020 and 2021 from the low 40% range in 2019. The loss of CAF II funding further lowers EBTIDA margins in 2022. Pressure in 2022 could be partly offset by future rural broadband subsidies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending reflects company plans of approximately $1.3 billion in 2020. Thereafter, capital intensity ranges from 16%-18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash taxes are nominal in 2020-2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The maximum DIP size is $1.65 billion as split between the term loan and notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Gross leverage, defined as total debt with equity credit/operating EBITDA, expected to be sustained at or below 3.0x, with FFO leverage of 3.0x, while consistently generating positive FCF margins in the mid-single-digits;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Greater certainty around the company's capital allocation given the new shareholder base upon emergence;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Successful execution on cost reduction plans;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Consistent gains in revenues from anticipated investments in fiber and broadband product areas;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrating stable EBITDA and FCF growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A weakening of operating results, including deteriorating EBITDA margins and an inability to stabilize revenue erosion in key product areas or offset EBITDA pressure through cost reductions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Discretionary management decisions, including but not limited to execution of M&A activity that increases gross leverage beyond 4.5x, with FFO leverage of 4.5x, in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a substantial amount of liquidity at the current point in time with more than $2 billion of cash. At emergence, the company expects to have $150 million of cash and an undrawn $625 million credit facility. First lien debt is expected to be $3.344 billion, second lien debt is expected to total $1.6 billion, and subsidiary debt is expected to total $856 million. Parent takeback debt is expected to be $750 million, and whether or not it is secured or unsecured will be determined at emergence. Fitch expects to provide a final rating on the takeback debt at that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Management Strategy due to operational challenges following the close of the Verizon transaction that resulted in elevated subscriber churn and weaker than expected revenue, which had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Except for the matters discussed above, the highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity(ies), either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity(ies).

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-16 April 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Corporation</span> (Frontier) and its subsidiaries to 'D' from 'C'. The security ratings of Frontier and its issuing subsidiaries are affirmed as shown at the end of this release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's rating actions follow the company, along with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, entering into a restructuring support agreement with certain of its bondholders. The agreement includes agreed-upon terms for a pre-arranged financial restructuring that leaves secured debtholders and general unsecured creditors unimpaired. Consenting noteholders have agreed to support a financial restructuring under the plan to be filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier and certain subsidiaries have entered into a commitment letter with a number of financial institutions for the provision of a DIP revolving credit facility in the amount of $460 million to satisfy the company's liquidity requirements during the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On March 16, 2020, Frontier announced that it planned to defer $322 million of coupon payments due on the 8.875% senior unsecured 2020 notes, 10.5% senior unsecured 2022 notes, 11% senior unsecured 2025 notes and 6.25% senior unsecured 2021 notes. Frontier had entered a 60-day grace period during which it was in negotiations with creditors regarding a potential capital restructuring. The company also deferred payments of interest due on April 1, 2020, pertaining to certain debentures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch may withdraw the ratings 30 days after a default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery Analysis: The recovery analysis assumes Frontier would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. Fitch assumed a 10% administrative claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier's going concern (GC) EBITDA estimate of approximately $2.6 billion reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level. The GC EBITDA incorporated in the analysis reflects the industry's intense competitive dynamics, resulting in customer losses and pricing pressures stressing profitability. In addition, the analysis excludes EBITDA from the Northwest operations, which are expected to be sold in the first half of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >For the GC, Fitch uses an enterprise value (EV) multiple of 4.8x to calculate a post-reorganization valuation. There are two bankruptcy cases of similar businesses analyzed in Fitch's telecom, media and technology bankruptcy case study report: <span class="companylink">FairPoint Communications, Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc</span>. Both filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged with multiplies of 4.6x and 3.7x, respectively. In addition, both were sold in recent acquisitions for 5.9x and 5.6x, respectively. The median multiple for the nine telecom companies in Fitch's report was 5.2x. Frontier's announced sale of its Northwest operations was in the low-5.0x range, taking into account the modest decline in EBITDA expected by the time the sale closes. In early-2020, the sale of <span class="companylink">Cincinnati Bell</span> was announced at a multiple of more than 6.0x. The slightly lower recovery multiple for Frontier takes into account its weaker competitive position in the industry and the company's exposure to legacy assets. Fitch notes the company benefits from a strong fiber-to-the-home network and the potential for broadband customer growth through the CAF II and forthcoming Rural Digital Opportunity Fund programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Operating Environment: Frontier's revenues declined 6% in 2019; revenues could remain pressured in 2020 due to economic weakness arising from the slowing economy and disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic. While telecom operators are not expected to be materially affected by the latter at this time, Fitch expects to see some weakness, primarily from small and medium businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pending Asset Sale: Frontier has a definitive agreement to sell its operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana (the Northwest operations) to WaveDivision Capital, LLC (WDC) for $1.352 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments. The transaction is expected close in 1H20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Commentary: Unless otherwise disclosed, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Frontier has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Management Strategy due operational challenges following the close of the Verizon transaction that resulted in elevated subscriber churn and weaker than expected revenue, which had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Fitch linked the IDRs of Frontier and its operating subsidiaries based on their strong operational ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a higher exposure to the more volatile residential market compared with <span class="companylink">CenturyLink, Inc</span>. (BB/Stable), one of its wireline peers, and to some extent, Windstream Services, LLC. Incumbent wireline operators within the residential market face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple-play offerings, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span>, BB+/Stable.) Cheaper alternative offerings, such as voiceover internet protocol and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline operators had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a relatively weak competitive position based on the scale and size of its operations in the higher-margin enterprise market. In this market, Frontier is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. (A-/Stable) and CenturyLink. All three companies have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Frontier also has a slightly smaller enterprise business than its wireline peer Windstream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with Frontier, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenues declined 6% in 2019, and a mid-single-digit decline in organic revenue is expected in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA is expected to decline due to pressure on revenues, partly offset by cost savings from efficiency initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating sensitivities do not apply given the financial restructuring plan to be filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier and certain subsidiaries have entered into a commitment letter with a number of financial institutions for the provision of a DIP revolving credit facility in the amount of $460 million to satisfy the company's liquidity requirements during the bankruptcy process. There is an option to convert the DIP facility into an exit RCF.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-17 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Corporation</span>'s and its subsidiaries' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'C' from 'CC'. In addition, Fitch has taken actions on the company's debt issues, as indicated at the end of this release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Today, Frontier announced that it was going to defer $322 million of coupon payments on the 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020, 10.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022, 11% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021. Frontier has now entered a 60-day grace period in order to continue negotiations with its unsecured noteholders regarding a potential capital restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Operating Environment: Frontier has not reported earnings for 2019. Fitch expects Frontier to report negative revenue trends in 2019, slightly less than the nearly 6% decline in 2018. Revenues could remain pressured in 2020 due to economic weakness arising from the slowing economy and disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic. While telecom operators are not expected to be materially affected by the latter at this time, Fitch expects to see some weakness, primarily from small and medium businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF and Debt: Fitch estimates FCF in the $300 million range over the 2019-2020 forecast period, including the effects of the sale of the Northwest operations. Frontier generated $513 million of FCF on a Fitch-calculated basis in 2018, and $620 million pro forma, which adds back $107 million in preferred dividends following the conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred to common in mid-2018. Pro forma for the sale of the Northwest operations and related debt reduction, Fitch estimates FCF in 2018 would have been around $550 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pending Asset Sale: Frontier has a definitive agreement to sell its operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana (the Northwest operations) to WaveDivision Capital, LLC (WDC) for $1.352 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments, and plans to use the proceeds to repay debt. The transaction is expected close in the first half of 2020 (1H20). Fitch estimates the transaction multiple is approximately 5.3x based on 2019 estimated EBITDA (Fitch-calculated EBITDA is before restructuring and other charges and a goodwill impairment) for the operations, 5% below 2018 EBITDA. The transaction is generally leverage-neutral given Frontier's LTM Fitch-calculated gross debt leverage of 5.2x at Sept. 30, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Commentary: Unless otherwise disclosed, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Management Strategy due operational challenges following the close of the Verizon transaction that resulted in elevated subscriber churn and weaker than expected revenue, which had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Fitch linked the IDRs of Frontier and its operating subsidiaries based on their strong operational ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery: The recovery analysis assumes Frontier would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. Fitch assumed a 10% administrative claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier's going concern (GC) EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level. The GC EBITDA incorporated in the analysis is well below LTM EBITDA for Sept. 30, 2019 to reflect the industry's intense competitive dynamics, resulting in customer losses and pricing pressures stressing profitability. In addition, the analysis excludes EBITDA from the Northwest operations, which are expected to be sold in 2020. In sum, the GC EBITDA is approximately 20% lower than LTM actual results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch uses an enterprise value (EV) multiple of 4.8x to calculate a post-reorganization valuation. There are two bankruptcy cases of similar businesses analyzed in Fitch's Telecom, Media & Technology bankruptcy case study report: <span class="companylink">FairPoint Communications, Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc</span>.. Both filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged with multiplies of 4.6x and 3.7x, respectively. In addition, both were sold in recent acquisitions for 5.9x and 5.6x, respectively. The median multiple for the nine telecom companies in Fitch's report was 5.2x. Frontier's announced sale of its Northwest operations was in the low 5x range, taking into account the modest decline in EBITDA expected by the time the sale closes. In early 2020, the sale of <span class="companylink">Cincinnati Bell</span> was announced at a multiple of more than 6x. The slightly lower recovery multiple for Frontier takes into account its weaker competitive position in the industry and the company's exposure to legacy assets. Fitch notes the company benefits from a strong fiber-to-the-home network and the potential for broadband customer growth through the CAF II program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The revolving credit facility (RCF) is assumed to be fully drawn upon default. The waterfall analysis results in an 'RR1' Recovery Rating for the secured debt, including the first-lien debt and RCF, and the second-lien senior secured notes. The waterfall also indicates an 'RR4' recovery for senior unsecured notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 'RR2' assigned to the approximately $450 million of outstanding subsidiary unsecured debt, excluding Frontier Florida LLC, reflects its structural seniority to all of the parent debt. The 'RR5' assigned to Frontier Florida's unsecured debt reflects Frontier Florida as a guarantor of Frontier's secured credit facility. The guarantee results in a lower estimated recovery value, 'RR5', for Frontier Florida's unsecured debt, as it ranks pari passu with the secured credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a higher exposure to the more volatile residential market compared with <span class="companylink">CenturyLink, Inc</span>. (BB/Stable), one of its wireline peers, and to some extent, Windstream Services, LLC. Incumbent wireline operators within the residential market face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple-play offerings, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> BB+/Stable.) Cheaper alternative offerings, such as voiceover internet protocol and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline operators had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a relatively weak competitive position based on the scale and size of its operations in the higher margin enterprise market. In this market, Frontier is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. (A-/Stable) and CenturyLink. All three companies have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Frontier also has a slightly smaller enterprise business than its wireline peer Windstream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with Frontier, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has not revised its previous base case, and Frontier has not disclosed 2019 financial results. In the prior base case:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenues are estimated to have declined in the high 4% range in 2019, and in the forecast the organic rate of decline reaches slightly less than 4% by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The EBITDA margin is expected to improve about 60 bps by 2020 relative to the Fitch-calculated EBITDA margin of 40.4% in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending reflects company guidance of approximately $1.2 billion in 2019. During the 2020-2022 forecast period, Fitch estimated capital intensity in the 13.8% to 13.9% range, with the absolute amount declining with the sale of the operations in the Northwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash taxes are expected to be nominal in 2019-2022. Fitch assumes that the company is able to use NOLs to offset taxes that may be due on the asset sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The forecast does not include an assumption regarding a restructuring, and reflects scheduled debt repayments through cash flow and the application of the asset sale proceeds from the sale of the Northwest operations. Proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion are used to reduce debt on an assumed close date of July 1, 2020.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A positive action is unlikely as a successful negotiation with noteholders around debt restructuring is likely to lead to a distressed debt exchange. Thereafter, positive actions could result from successful execution of its business transformation plan, such that the company demonstrates stabile revenue and EBITDA trends. Additionally, FCF margins sustained in the mid to high single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A downgrade to 'RD' could result from a distressed debt exchange, and a downgrade to 'D' will result from a failure to negotiate an agreement with noteholders that results in a bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Refinancing Plans and Activities: Frontier's liquidity position was adequate as of Sept. 30, 2019, supported by $683 million of cash; Frontier had drawn $749 million on its $850 million RCF, and LOCs use the remainder of the RCF's capacity. Fitch's prior base case expected Frontier would generate positive FCF during 2020.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-23 January 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Frontier Communications</b> Corporation</span> and its subsidiaries to 'CC' from 'CCC'. Fitch has also downgraded the ratings of the company's debt issues. The downgrade incorporates a material level of market information regarding the hiring of financial advisors and law firms, as well as various lenders hiring financial advisors, suggesting a probable restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >News sources over the last two months have reported that Frontier has been getting advice from <span class="companylink">Kirkland & Ellis LLP</span> and <span class="companylink">Evercore Inc</span>. News sources have also reported certain creditors have hired telecom consulting firm <span class="companylink">Altman Vilandrie & Co</span>. to develop a post-reorganization business plan. A creditor group including <span class="companylink">Elliott Management Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Franklin Resources Inc</span>. have organized with law firm <span class="companylink">Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP</span> and investment bank Ducera Partners LLC. A separate group of creditors including <span class="companylink">GoldenTree Asset Management LP</span> organized with <span class="companylink">Houlihan Lokey Inc</span>. and Milbank LLP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade of Frontier and its subsidiaries IDRs to 'CC' reflects a default of some kind appears probable. In Fitch's opinion, Frontier has limited options with respect to $2.7 billion in maturities in 2022 and nearly $900 million in 2023. Fitch expects FCF to exceed maturities through 2021, lowering the possibility of an imminent payment default, but increasing the probability that a restructuring or a distressed debt exchange (DDE) is attempted to address upcoming maturities and to lower debt overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Challenging Operating Environment: Frontier's rating incorporates a challenging operating environment for wireline operators. Fitch expects Frontier to report negative revenue trends in 2019 (results have not yet been released), with the decline slightly less than the nearly 6% decline in 2018, and to show a modest improvement in EBITDA margins. To maintain or improve margins, the company has implemented a business transformation program. Fitch expects modest improvements in the rate of decline in revenue in 2020 and thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier revised its estimates for its business-transformation program in August 2019. Savings estimates were revised up for 2019, as the company now expects EBITDA benefits up to $110 million-$150 million, compared with a prior target of $50 million-$100 million. The company continued to expect run-rate benefits of $200 million exiting 2019. However, expectations for 2020 were lowered, as Frontier has run into some challenges improving revenue and customer trends, and revised its EBITDA benefit targets exiting 2020 to a range of $200 million-$250 million, down from the previous estimate of up to a $500 million run rate. The degree of execution risk Frontier faces in achieving its goals for improving revenue performance was previously highlighted by Fitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF and Debt: Fitch is estimating FCF in the $300 million to $400 million range over 2019-2020, including the effects of the sale of the Northwest operations. Frontier generated $513 million of FCF on a Fitch-calculated basis in 2018 — $620 million pro forma, which adds back $107 million in preferred dividends following the conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred to common in mid-2018. Pro forma for the sale of Northwest operations and related debt reduction, Fitch estimates FCF in 2018 would have been around $550 million annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pending Asset Sale: Frontier has a definitive agreement to sell its operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana (the Northwest operations) to WaveDivision Capital, LLC (WDC) for $1.352 billion in cash, subject to closing adjustments, and plans to use the proceeds to repay debt. The transaction is expected close in 1H20. Fitch estimates the transaction multiple is approximately 5.3x based on 2019 estimated EBITDA (Fitch-calculated EBITDA is before restructuring and other charges and a goodwill impairment) for the operations — 5% below 2018 EBITDA. The transaction is generally leverage-neutral given Frontier's LTM Fitch-calculated gross debt leverage of 5.2x at Sept. 30, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Relationship: Fitch linked the IDRs of Frontier and its operating subsidiaries based on their strong operational ties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Recovery: The recovery analysis assumes Frontier would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. Fitch assumed a 10% administrative claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier's going concern (GC) EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level. The GC EBITDA incorporated in the analysis is well below LTM EBITDA for Sept. 30, 2019 to reflect the industry's intense competitive dynamics, resulting in customer losses and pricing pressures stressing profitability. In addition, the analysis excludes EBITDA from the Northwest operations, which are expected to be sold in 2020. In sum, the GC EBITDA is approximately 20% lower than LTM actual results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >An enterprise value (EV) multiple of 4.8x is used to calculate a post-reorganization valuation. There are two bankruptcy cases of similar businesses analyzed in Fitch's Telecom, Media & Technology bankruptcy case study report — <span class="companylink">FairPoint Communications, Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc</span>. — both of which filed bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged with multiplies of 4.6x and 3.7x, respectively. Both were also sold in recent acquisitions for 5.9x and 5.6x, respectively. The median multiple for the nine telecom companies in Fitch's report was 5.2x. Frontier's announced sale of its Northwest operations was in the low 5x range, taking into account the modest decline in EBITDA expected by the time the sale closes. In late 2019, the sale of <span class="companylink">Cincinnati Bell</span> was announced at a multiple of 6.3x. The slightly lower recovery multiple for Frontier takes into account its weaker competitive position in the industry and the company's exposure to legacy assets. Fitch notes the company benefits from a strong fiber-to-the-home network and the potential for broadband customer growth through the CAF II program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The revolving credit facility (RCF) is assumed to be fully drawn upon default. The waterfall analysis results in an 'RR1' Recovery Rating for the secured debt, including the first-lien debt and RCF, and the second-lien senior secured notes. The waterfall also indicates an 'RR4' recovery for senior unsecured notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 'RR2' assigned to the approximately $450 million of outstanding subsidiary unsecured debt, excluding Frontier Florida LLC, reflects its structural seniority to all of the parent debt. The 'RR5' assigned to Frontier Florida's unsecured debt reflects Frontier Florida as a guarantor of Frontier's secured credit facility. The guarantee results in a lower estimated recovery value, 'RR5', for Frontier Florida's unsecured debt, as it ranks pari passu with the secured credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a higher exposure to the more volatile residential market compared with <span class="companylink">CenturyLink, Inc</span>. (BB/Stable), one of its wireline peers, and to some extent, Windstream Services, LLC. Incumbent wireline operators within the residential market face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple-play offerings, including <span class="companylink">Comcast Corp</span>. (A-/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Charter Communications Inc</span>. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, <span class="companylink">CCO Holdings, LLC</span> BB+/Stable.) Cheaper alternative offerings, such as voiceover internet protocol and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline operators had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier has a relatively weak competitive position based on the scale and size of its operations in the higher margin enterprise market. In this market, Frontier is smaller than <span class="companylink">AT&T Inc</span>. (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications Inc</span>. (A-/Stable) and CenturyLink. All three companies have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Frontier also has a slightly smaller enterprise business than its wireline peer Windstream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with Frontier, <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Organic revenues are estimated to have declined in the high 4% range in 2019, and in the forecast the organic rate of decline reaches slightly less than 4% by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The EBITDA margin is expected to improve about 60 bps by 2020 relative to the Fitch-calculated EBITDA margin of 40.4% in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capital spending reflects company guidance of approximately $1.2 billion in 2019. During the 2020-2022 forecast period, Fitch estimated capital intensity in the 13.8% to 13.9% range, with the absolute amount declining with the sale of the operations in the Northwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Cash taxes are expected to be nominal in 2019-2022. Fitch assumes that the company is able to use NOLs to offset taxes that may be due on the asset sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The forecast does not include an assumption regarding a restructuring, and reflects scheduled debt repayments through cash flow and the application of the asset sale proceeds from the sale of the Northwest operations. Proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion are used to reduce debt on an assumed close date of July 1, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A positive rating action could occur if the company can successfully address the significant level of unsecured maturities in 2022, without entering bankruptcy or conducting a DDE, while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity to meet its ongoing debt obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A negative rating action could result from a DDE or a more comprehensive restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Refinancing Plans and Activities: Frontier's liquidity position was adequate as of Sept. 30, 2019, supported by $683 million of cash; Frontier has drawn $749 million on its $850 million RCF, and LOCs use the remainder of the RCF's capacity. Fitch expects FCF will be positive, in the mid-single-digit percentage of revenue in the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >An excess cash flow (ECF) sweep is in effect on the term loan, requiring mandatory prepayments of 25% and 50% of ECF if YE net debt/EBITDA is above 5.00x and 5.25x, respectively. No payment in 2019 under the ECF sweep was required based on YE 2018 net debt/EBITDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In March 2019, Frontier issued $1.65 billion of 8.0% first-lien senior secured notes due 2027. Proceeds were used to entirely repay the $1.4 billion in outstanding borrowings on its term loan A facility (balance as of Dec. 31, 2018) and its $239 million <span class="companylink">CoBank</span> ACB facility (balance as of Dec. 31), which both would have matured in 2021. The remaining proceeds were used to pay related fees and expenses. Frontier amended its credit agreement following the transaction's close to extend the maturity of the $850 million revolver to February 2024 from February 2022, subject to certain springing maturity dates to any tranche of existing debt in excess of $500 million. Pricing on the revolver also increased by 0.25%, and certain amendments were made to the debt and restricted payments covenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The springing maturities on the revolver and term loan B occur if more than $500 million in principal remains outstanding on any series 91 days before the maturity of senior unsecured notes in 2020, 2023 and 2024, or if more than $500 million remains outstanding in aggregate 91 days before the maturity of notes maturing in 2021 or 2022 on the two series of notes maturing in those years. As of Sept. 30, 2019, $227 million is outstanding on the two series of notes maturing in 2020 and $309 million on the two series of notes maturing in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Based on the current principal amounts outstanding, the springing maturities would first come into play for $500 million of notes due in April 2022 and $2.2 billion of notes due in September 2022. There is also a single series of notes exceeding $500 million in each of 2023 and 2024, in the amounts of $850 million and $750 million, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Frontier borrowed an incremental $240 million on its senior secured term loan B facility in July 2018. Proceeds were used to repay all borrowings under its <span class="companylink">CoBank</span> credit facility due in October 2019 and to pay down a small portion of the <span class="companylink">CoBank</span> facility due in 2021. Frontier also obtained technical amendments to its credit agreements with <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A</span>. and <span class="companylink">CoBank</span> to replace certain operating subsidiary equity pledges — with negative pledges provided to the former pledge subsidiaries — with equity pledges of direct, intermediate holding company subsidiaries of Frontier not previously pledged. The change increases the percentage of revenue, EBITDA and assets in the security package for the facilities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Copyright © 2020 by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings Ltd</span>. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>
