</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-30 June 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has revised the Rating Outlook on <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Stable from Negative and has affirmed the IDR at 'BBB-'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s Short-Term IDR and CP rating at 'F3' and its senior unsecured notes and revolvers at 'BBB-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Outlook revision to Stable reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that the post-strike production ramp and enhanced financial flexibility, including the announced Jeppesen sale, have reduced downgrade risks and support the 'BBB-' rating. The Stable Outlook also incorporates <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation of gross debt reduction, including repayment of all 2026 notes at maturity ($7.95 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sustained operational improvements, particularly continued 737MAX production progress, should drive FCF generation and EBITDA leverage metrics consistent with 'BBB-' thresholds. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will monitor <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s ability to maintain operational momentum and provide greater clarity on long-term capital allocation, which could support further rating improvement within 6-12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">BCA</span> Stabilization Drives Credit Enhancement: The Stable Outlook reflects the significant post-strike operational progress at <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes (BCA), supporting the investment-grade credit profile. <span class="companylink">BCA</span> has increased 737MAX production to the mid-30s per month, targeting 38 per month during 3Q25. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects 787 production to average eight per month in 2026, up from an average of six in 2025. Production sustained at these levels supports FCF generation, subject to 777X production pace and certification status, with higher output incrementally de-risking the operational and FCF profiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has also reduced legacy inventory, delivering 10-15 parked aircraft each month. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the reduction of legacy 737MAX inventory to facilitate the progressive return to a more normalized production-to-delivery cadence, driving substantial improvements in working capital and enabling annual FCF generation in the mid-to-high single-digit billions by 2026. The closure of shadow factories is expected to unlock resources to further support safety and quality targets and enable sustained higher production levels, allowing the company to achieve more predictable delivery schedules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Reduction and Capital Structure Improvement: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt reduction efforts, coupled with anticipated EBITDA recovery as production rates normalize, are expected to drive leverage metrics toward 'BBB' thresholds in the 2027 period. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts EBITDA leverage to improve to below 4.0x and 3.0x in 2026 and 2027, respectively. The company's robust liquidity position, with approximately $34 billion in proforma cash and short-term investments, including the announced Jeppesen sale, as of March 31, 2025, provides additional financial flexibility during this transition period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $24 billion equity issuance in late 2024 materially strengthened <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s balance sheet, enabling the company to de-risk its financial profile while supporting operational execution. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to retire all 2026 notes ($7.95 billion) upon their respective maturities. This would drive gross debt below $50 billion in 2026, a key consideration in the Stable Outlook revision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$545+ Billion Backlog Provides Visibility: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s multi-year backlog provides strong visibility into future production and underscores sustained demand for its commercial aircraft portfolio. As of March 31, 2025, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s total backlog exceeded $545 billion, with approximately $460 billion tied to commercial customers. This includes orders for over 5,600 aircraft, of which more than 4,300 are 737s. This robust order book extends into the next decade and reinforces <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s confidence in the company's long-term revenue generation capability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Portfolio Optimization Supports Liquidity, Strategy: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s plan to divest portions of its Digital Aviation Solutions business (Jeppesen) to <span class="companylink">Thoma Bravo</span> for $10.55 billion represents a significant milestone in the company's portfolio optimization strategy. This transaction, which is not subject to capital market risk and is expected to close in 4Q25, will provide substantial incremental liquidity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views positively management's commitment to further streamline operations through additional pruning of peripheral business segments, which should enhance focus on core aerospace capabilities while generating proceeds to support the balance sheet and fund strategic initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Certifications Would Accelerate Recovery: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates that achieving 777X certification will further catalyze <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial improvement. Expected in early 2026, the certification would unlock significant working capital currently tied up in inventory, potentially avoiding a production versus FCF decision in case of extended delays. The resulting boost to FCF would enhance financial flexibility, supporting debt reduction efforts and enhancing capital allocation flexibility. Certifications for the 737MAX-7 and -10 variants would also be favorable, but backlog depth and the substitutability of other MAX variants helps mitigate the near-term impact on the credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Legacy Defense Contracts Remain Overhang: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment remains weighed down by loss-making legacy contracts, particularly in its fixed-price development, fighter, and satellite programs, which together represent about 40% of the portfolio. Losses are likely to continue until these programs conclude, despite ongoing efforts to mitigate operational and financial impacts. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects management to continue reviewing the portfolio and divesting non-core BDS assets over the next few years, potentially sharpening focus on core areas such as fixed-wing aircraft, as demonstrated by the recent sixth-generation fighter contract win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Future Capital Deployment Awaits Clarification: Greater clarity around <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s capital spending and allocation priorities, particularly regarding the new <span class="companylink">U.S. Air Force</span> F-47 program and 2027 debt maturities, would further strengthen its credit profile. A defined long-term strategy balancing growth, debt reduction, and potential shareholder returns would improve visibility into <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s priorities and reinforce confidence in its financial trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Peer Analysis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated four notches below its most immediate peer, <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A/Stable). This is largely due to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operational challenges over the past several years, which have combined to weaken its quantitative rating factors compared with <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. In the past, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved significantly better FCF and funds from operations due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737MAX grounding and subsequent disruptions severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow and caused debt to rise significantly versus <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense, in addition to services. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> currently has meaningfully stronger leverage metrics. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> generally operates with a net cash position, though both companies have significant financial flexibility. Foreign exchange exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, with the former having less exposure and the latter with more significant exposure, although <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> has taken steps to address this.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity as sufficient with proforma cash and investments around $34 billion, including the announced Jeppesen sale, as of March 31, 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will maintain full revolver availability and aim to sustain greater than $10 billion of cash over the next few years. We currently expect this will be adequate to cover negative FCF in 2025 and repayment of 2026 maturities, and project that FCF will exhibit improving trends with positive mid-single-digit billion-dollar FCF in 2026. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt structure is predominantly comprised of senior unsecured notes, revolvers and commercial paper availability.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Toronto-26 June 2025: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s (BBB-/Negative) steady production improvement enhances stability across the aerospace supply chain and could support a recovery in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) issuances beginning in 2H25 or 2026, <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> says. Rising aircraft deliveries bolsters confidence among suppliers and airlines, provides greater certainty for fleet planning and aircraft financing, and contributes to a more predictable operating environment for the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s operational progress is gaining traction following the resolution of the 2024 machinist strike, management changes, and increased production oversight. 737MAX production rates have climbed into the mid-30s per month, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects run rates to reach 38 per month in 3Q25. The clearance of legacy inventory, with 10-15 previously built aircraft delivered each month, has provided a near-term boost to cash generation and working capital efficiency, while freeing up resources to support further production improvements. These operational milestones, along with the $24 billion equity raise and the pending $10.55 billion sale of Jeppesen, provide <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> with greater financial flexibility to manage its backlog and future investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consistent and predictable production at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> benefits suppliers and airline customers. More reliable delivery schedules support long-term fleet planning and enable a more orderly retirement of older aircraft, which is expected to normalize over the next year. The stabilization of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s supply chain, despite lingering risks from tariffs and geopolitical tensions, adds further confidence for tier-one and tier-two suppliers such as <span class="companylink">Howmet Aerospace</span> (BBB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Hexcel Corporation</span> (BBB-/Stable), many of whom rely on steady volumes to manage costs and investment. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has indicated that its current supply chain is sufficient to support a 737MAX production rate of 38 aircraft per month, but additional improvements will likely be needed to accommodate higher output in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Normalized aircraft production will also support aircraft financing markets. EETC issuance has been muted in recent years, reflecting airlines’ reluctance to lock in fixed-rate debt at elevated levels and ongoing uncertainty around aircraft delivery timing. Persistent delivery delays have complicated EETC structures, which often pre-fund future aircraft deliveries and include a specified delivery window from the time of funding. If manufacturers fail to deliver within this window, airlines must return unutilized funds to investors and secure alternative financing for the delayed aircraft. Disruptions highlighted by the 2024 <span class="companylink">Alaska Airlines</span> door-plug incident resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny and production delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects EETC issuance to increase as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> demonstrates greater consistency in meeting scheduled deliveries. Improved certainty, together with substantial orderbooks that require financing, is likely to support a recovery in EETC issuance beginning in the second half of 2025 or into 2026. EETCs remain attractive to airlines with large orderbooks, as they offer an efficient means to finance batches of aircraft with investment-grade rated debt. With <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s backlog approaching 6,000 commercial aircraft and delivery schedules now more reliable, upcoming certifications for the 737MAX-7, -10, and 777X could further support a rise in EETC volumes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >but does not anticipate significant order deferrals or cancellations, particularly among typical EETC issuers. Aircraft purchase decisions have a lengthy planning cycle, and airlines remain motivated to modernize fleets for fuel efficiency and cost savings, and to increase average seat counts. Instead of pulling back on aircraft deliveries, airlines will likely manage seat capacity through retirement of older planes or reduced daily utilization. Backlogs for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> aircraft are greater than 5,900 and 8,000 planes, respectively, with wait times for new deliveries extending multiple years.</p>

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York/Chicago/Toronto-11 March 2025: <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (‘BBB-’/Negative Outlook) has made early progress in resuming production post-strike, reducing legacy inventory, and managing supply chains, says <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. While escalating trade and geopolitical tensions are a risk, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s operational execution, profitability improvement, and balance sheet management as the main drivers for its rating over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has exhibited early progress resuming production, reducing legacy inventory, and managing supply chains after ending the strike and raising $24 billion in late 2024. The monthly production run rate for 737MAX has reached the low-to-mid 20s, with legacy inventory deliveries at about 10 per month. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the initial post-strike operational progress paves the way to produce 38 units per month in 3Q25. While this represents a slight delay from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s commercial revenues and profitability are currently constrained by production rather than end-market demand, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not view the risk of retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made aircraft as a significant rating driver. Market values for commercial</p>

                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >have risen, supported by strong demand, supply constraints, and ongoing fleet replacement needs. Long-term demand strength is evident in the order backlogs of both <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> (A-/Positive), which extend to the end of the decade. As of Dec. 31, 2024, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplane</span> reported a backlog of $435 billion, comprising 5,554 aircraft, including 4,296 737 aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Trump administration’s recent threats to scale back military support for Europe have raised concerns that some <span class="companylink">EU</span> countries may divert military spending to European defense companies, at the expense of U.S. companies. Such a shift would encounter numerous obstacles, require significant investment, and likely take many years to achieve at scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The more imminent challenge faced by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment is its loss-making legacy contracts. These include fixed-price development programs, and the fighter and satellite programs, which together comprise roughly 40% of the portfolio. Losses are likely to persist until these programs conclude in the coming years, despite <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s efforts to engage with customers to manage operational and financial impacts. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes management will likely manage and, in some cases, divest non-core components of the BDS portfolio over the next few years. This will be followed by a more comprehensive, strategic portfolio realignment to enhance operational focus on core competencies, such as fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The equity raising in late 2024 enabled <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to prepay most of its 2025 debt maturities and reduce gross debt to about $53.9 billion at YE 2024. With cash and investments around $26.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2024, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has considerable financial flexibility to meet anticipated liquidity needs in 2025 as operations stabilize. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> continues to forecast FCF in the mid-single-digit billions, gross debt below $50 billion, and EBITDA leverage under 4x in 2026, in-line with investment-grade rating tolerances. Securing additional non-debt capital would further de-risk <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s financial profile and support positive rating momentum.</p>

                        <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>’s (<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>; BBB-/Negative) announced equity offering supports debt repayment and increases financial flexibility amidst continued operational challenges, alleviating downgrade risk, says <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> continues to evaluate the company’s ability to resolve its labor negotiations, regain operational momentum, and adhere to our negative rating sensitivity of decreasing gross debt below $50 billion and EBITDA leverage below 4x by YE 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The $17.5 billion equity offering demonstrates management’s willingness to access non-debt capital sources to preserve its $10 billion cash target, repay 2025-2026 maturities of around $12 billion, and fund expected cash needs into 2026. Pro forma cash and equivalents will be approximately $28 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> launched its offering with a combination of $12.5 billion in common equity and $5 billion in mandatory convertibles. The mandatory convertibles offering will have conversion date and rate, subordination, dividend deferral, and settlement features to receive 100% equity treatment as defined in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The <span class="companylink">IAM union</span> strike continues prolonging the re-establishment of operational momentum. A labor resolution is a necessary first step to restart production of the company’s flagship 737MAX aircraft. The equity offering enhances financial flexibility and moderates the credit impact of strike-related delays. The improvement in the most recent voting outcome, albeit short of ratification, suggests contract terms are approaching acceptability for at least the majority of union members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s post-strike focus remains on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s ability to achieve key commercial aircraft operational milestones to facilitate cash flow generation and enhance deleveraging capacity. These</p>

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago/New York/Toronto-15 October 2024: <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (‘BBB-’/Negative Outlook) announcements today increase financial flexibility and moderate near-term liquidity concerns amidst an extended strike and continued operational challenges, says <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> continues to evaluate the company’s ability to adhere to our negative rating sensitivity of decreasing gross debt below $50 billion and EBITDA leverage below 4x by year-end 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Management’s willingness and ability to access non-debt capital sources over the coming months will help alleviate downgrade risks by supporting repayment of 2025-26 maturities and increasing financial flexibility. The $25 billion S-3 shelf registration filing today accommodates broader market access, including the issuance of equity. The establishment of the up to $10 billion 364-day facility provides a short-term liquidity buffer and we expect any draws to be temporary. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> reported cash and equivalents of approximately $10.5 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >An enhanced liquidity position helps offset operational execution risks as management navigates the labor strike and works toward re-establishing post-strike momentum, receiving certification approvals, normalizing operations, and integrating <span class="companylink">Spirit AeroSystems</span> into 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes management’s announcement to winddown the 767 program helps heighten operational focus. The announced organizational actions should improve operational efficiency and provide considerable cost savings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s September delivery of 33 commercial aircraft, including 27 737MAXs, incrementally supports liquidity and decreases legacy inventory. Continued production progress of the 787 aircraft, which is not affected by the strike, also provides some cash flows and operational continuity. The company received 65 gross orders, including 54 737MAXs and 11 777s, in September suggesting continued commercial interest and backlog strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s forecast currently assumes the shadow factory is closed and 737MAX production of 38 per month is achieved in late 1Q25/early 2Q25. This would allow management to focus on the completion and integration of the <span class="companylink">Spirit AeroSystems</span> acquisition. Positive working capital reduction and cost savings are projected to contribute to low/mid-single digit billions of FCF in 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts FCF of mid/high-single digit billions, gross debt below $50 billion, and EBITDA leverage under 4x in 2026.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago/New York-13 September 2024: <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>’s investment-grade credit rating has limited headroom for a strike, according to <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. If the current strike lasts a week or two, it is unlikely to pressure the rating. However, an extended strike could have a meaningful operational and financial impact, increasing the risk of a downgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Management would likely need to access new liquidity sources in an extended strike scenario to adhere to its cash targets and remain within <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s negative rating sensitivity, including decreasing gross debt below $50 billion and EBITDA leverage below 4x by year-end 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Although the current labor negotiations create near-term uncertainty, we believe management understands the importance of reaching a timely agreement that supports the maintenance of its current investment-grade ratings. Our ratings case forecasts do not assume an operationally disruptive labor action but do account for union-linked labor cost increases under new contracts. These incremental costs suggest the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Labor costs per 737MAX are about 15% of each aircraft, with union labor costs accounting for around one-third, or roughly 5% of total aircraft costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >If the strike is prolonged, we will assess management’s willingness and ability to preserve and enhance its liquidity position. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s Negative Rating Outlook also reflects the operational and certification risks to achieving run-rate production during 2026-2027. This includes elimination of legacy inventory, certification of the 737MAX-7, 737MAX-10 and 777X aircraft, stabilization of and increases in aircraft production rates, and navigation of seasonal cash flow volatility. These steps should enhance longer-term operations and help fulfill <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s commitment to repay debt and return to investment-grade metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s ‘BBB-’ rating incorporates 737MAX production increasing towards mid-30 per month by year-end and liquidation of approximately half of the company’s pre-2023 built 737MAX inventory during 2024. The company has been taking steps to achieve a 737MAX production rate of 38 aircraft per month in 4Q24. Deliveries from inventory were also on track to allow closure of its shadow factories around year-end. The achievement of these milestones will be important in establishing the operational efficiency and momentum to support production growth, as well as margin expansion and positive free cash flow realization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s last strike in 2008 lasted 57 days with a 52-day production shutdown that necessitated 4-6 weeks to return production to pre-strike levels. A strike of similar length and operational impact would materially hinder operational momentum and pressure liquidity. This could result in a negative rating action without the addition of new liquidity in a credit-conscious manner.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-01 July 2024: <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BBB-/Negative Outlook) announcement of an all-stock offer to purchase <span class="companylink">Spirit Aerosystems</span> has no near-term rating impact, according to <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the transaction will be operationally beneficial to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, as it will allow the company to better plan and control the pacing of future 737 MAX production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The all-stock funding decision is favorable compared to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior expectation and limits the need for additional debt, while retaining financial flexibility during a period of heighted operational execution risk. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects most known quality control issues with the 737MAX to be evaluated and resolved before the acquisition closes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The transaction announcement does not materially affect <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 2024 or 2025 production or delivery expectations. However, a lower debt burden should free up incremental FCF for debt repayment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts between 350-370 737MAX deliveries and about 65-70 787 deliveries in 2024. The agency also forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 737MAX production rate in the low-30s by the end of 2024 and mid-30s by early 2025, as well as around three 787s per month during 2024, before returning to five per month in 2025. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s FCF will be modestly negative in 2024, but will return to low-single digit positive billions in 2025 and mid-single digit billions in 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Outlook reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s heightened execution risks over the next 12 to 24 months as it eliminates legacy inventory, stabilizes and increases aircraft production rates, navigates seasonal cash flow volatility, pursues additional corporate actions that should enhance longer-term operations and fulfills its commitment to repay debt and return to IG metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could revise the Outlook if <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> liquidates over 100 of its pre-2023 built 737 MAX and half of its 787 inventories by early 2025 and 737 MAX production increases toward 38 per month. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes these actions would alleviate operational strain and enable management to focus on the <span class="companylink">Spirit Aerosystems</span> integration. These improvements will also provide a path towards operational normalization and production optimization, facilitating FCF acceleration, debt repayment and return to an IG financial profile.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-31 May 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has lowered its 2024 forecasts for <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>’s aircraft deliveries and FCF due to recent developments. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not currently expect these adjustments to result in rating changes. However, we will continue to assess the company’s operational progress toward material aircraft inventory liquidation and 737MAX production above 30 per month. Failure to achieve a clear path to these milestones by mid-2025 remains our key downgrade trigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts between 350-370 737MAX deliveries and about 65-70 787 deliveries in 2024, below previous expectations of about 400 and 75, respectively. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also expects modestly negative FCF during 2024, compared to previous breakeven-to-positive. These changes are incorporated in <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s ‘BBB-’ Long-term Issuer Default Rating and Negative Rating Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The delivery forecasts were affected by the <span class="companylink">Civil Aviation Administration of China</span>’s (CAAC) decision to restrict certain aircraft model deliveries to Chinese customers while it requests additional documentation regarding voice recorder and battery information. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the CAAC’s restriction of deliveries could be resolved by mid-Q3 but would still result in at least 20-30 fewer 737MAX deliveries out of inventory and five fewer 787 deliveries out of inventory during 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s forecast adjustments also reflect the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span>’s decision to maintain oversight within <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s factories while individually certifying newly produced aircraft. The <span class="companylink">FAA</span> maintaining oversight was generally an expected outcome, though comments from the head of the <span class="companylink">FAA</span>, Mike Whitaker, indicated that oversight will continue for at least the next few months. While this scrutiny by the <span class="companylink">FAA</span> is a near-term negative, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes it should support operational quality and normalization once the oversight starts tapering off. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently believes this will gradually begin during the end of 3Q24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >These changes do not alter <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>’s view that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could reach a 737MAX production rate in the low-30s by the end of 2024 and mid-30s by early 2025, but could affect the rate of increase during the upcoming summer months. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s path to produce 38 737MAXs per month and liquidate inventoried aircraft will be uneven over the next nine to 12 months. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> is unlikely to revise <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s Outlook back to Stable until the company makes progress toward completing these objectives. We have therefore reduced our production expectations for the remainder of 2024 and delayed the pace of increase above 38 per month until late-2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also considered the ongoing 787 investigation in our analysis. We primarily focused on the impact on production rather than the potential future fines due to the uncertainty around hypothetical amounts and payment timing. We currently expect the company to produce closer to three 787s per month during 2024, before returning to five per month in 2025.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-29 April 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB-' ratings to <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>) new senior unsecured notes, which will be used to fund general corporate purposes. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also revised <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s Rating Outlook to Negative on April 26, 2024, while also affirming its 'BBB-' long-term ratings and 'F3' short-term ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Outlook reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s heightened execution risks over the next 12 months to 24 months as it eliminates legacy inventory, stabilizes and increases aircraft production rates, navigates seasonal cash flow volatility, pursues additional corporate actions that should enhance longer-term operations and fulfills its commitment to repay debt and return to IG metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could stabilize the Outlook if <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> liquidates over 100 of its pre-2023 built 737MAX and half of its 787 inventories by early 2025 and 737MAX production increases toward 38 per month. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes these actions would alleviate operational strain and enable management to focus on the potential <span class="companylink">Spirit Aerosystems</span> integration in 1H25. These improvements will also provide a path towards operational normalization and production optimization, facilitating FCF acceleration, debt repayment and return to an IG financial profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 'BBB-' rating is supported by a $529 billion backlog (up about 30% during 2023), which provides several years of revenue visibility. The company is one of two major global aircraft manufacturers with substantial diversification to differentiate it from its largest competitor, particularly given its large defense and services businesses. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects the company will continue to generate positive annual FCF throughout its rating case with potential to approach double digit billions by the end of 2027 as operations normalize and operating margins improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Issuance Extends Elevated Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s new debt will help de-risk 2025 liquidity needs and restore cash balances around $10 billion, while staying ahead of liquidity needs over the next 12 months. The use of proceeds will provide a cushion against expected annual Q1 FCF seasonality ahead of upcoming maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects near-term leverage will remain well outside of its 4.0x negative sensitivity in 2024 and 2025 but will return inside by approximately YE 2026 before further declining below 3.0x by YE 2027 as a result of a combination of gross debt repayment over the three-year period and production- and efficiency-linked operating margin improvements. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes a potential all-debt-funded acquisition of <span class="companylink">Spirit</span> is captured within the Negative Outlook and that the debt issuance provides incremental financial flexibility during a period of heightened operational execution risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the near-term financial pressures from incremental debt and expected capital investment will be mostly offset by the near-term focus on inventory reduction and production optimization and longer-term synergies if <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> takes control of <span class="companylink">Spirit</span>. The fuselages that <span class="companylink">Spirit</span> produces effectively set the pace of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s production line, and having greater control and visibility into timing and quality of the input will better allow <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to stabilize and normalize production rates, and plan for future increases. Since the transaction is not likely to close sooner than six to nine months after a potential announcement, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the majority of the known quality control concerns related to the 737MAX will be in the process of being evaluated and alleviated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational Challenges Temper FCF: Investment and working capital fluctuations, coupled with heightened execution risks around 2024-25 operational objectives, will likely result in weaker 2024 and 2025 FCF than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> previously expected. However, forecasted positive margin trends in the <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment will accelerate FCF and deleveraging capacity heading into 2026, little changed from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s March 2024 review. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s FCF should then approach the double-digit billion-dollar level after the company liquidates its remaining aircraft inventory and shuts down its shadow factories, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently projects to be largely completed by YE 2025, subject to MAX-7 and MAX-10 certification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FAA Investigation Disruptive but Manageable: The <span class="companylink">FAA</span> recently completed a quality control audit of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s production processes following the January 2024 incident involving an <span class="companylink">Alaska Airlines</span> flight. The investigation resulted in greater operational disruption and slower 737MAX production than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> previously anticipated during the first few months of 2024. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has until late-May 2024 to develop a plan to address the various concerns and failures highlighted by the <span class="companylink">FAA</span>, during which time <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will continue to operate at a slower production pace in line with early 2024 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Deliveries Update: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts around low-400s 737MAX deliveries in 2024 and expects the production rate to remain constrained below 20 per month for 1H, steadily rising towards the mid-30s by the end of the year. We further forecast the company will liquidate slightly more than half of its approximately 200 737MAX aircraft in inventory by YE 2024. We also forecast around 75 787 aircraft deliveries during the year, with low- to mid-single-digit production per month and liquidation of around 30 out of 60 787 aircraft in inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$520+ Billion Backlog Provides Visibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s multi-year and growing backlog to be one of the key positive considerations when evaluating the company's business profile. As of December 2023, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a total backlog of over $520 billion, approximately $120 billion higher than the previous year. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the commercial airplanes backlog of $440 billion represents greater than seven years of revenue at <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-projected 2025-2026 production levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Defense and Services Bolsters Diversification: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span> (BDS) and <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS) segments as net positives for the company due to the high degree of diversification provided by contract, program and capability. Independently, BDS would represent a top-five global defense contractor, by revenue. The segment also operates in a variety of high priority areas such as space, drones and aircraft, which should remain key focus areas for the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> over the next several years. Meanwhile, BGS provides steady margins and cash flows in addition to stability from aftermarket sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated three notches below its most immediate peer, <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Stable). This is largely the result of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s execution challenges in the past several years, which have combined to weaken its quantitative rating factors compared with <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. In the past, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved significantly better FCF and funds from operations due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737MAX grounding and subsequent disruptions severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow and caused debt to rise significantly versus <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense, in addition to services. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> currently has a stronger balance sheet, though <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> plans to use nearly all excess cash to repay debt. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> generally operates with a net cash position, though both companies have significant financial flexibility. Foreign exchange exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> has taken modest actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> issues new debt to, bolster financial flexibility and de-risk liquidity and refinance needs ahead of expected seasonal cash outflows in early-2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue/FCF: Overall revenue up low-single-digits in 2024, double-digits in 2025, 2026 and 2027; FCF breakeven-to-positive in 2024, low-single digit billions in 2025 and high single-digits in 2026 and 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Production rates: 737MAX production rate remains constrained during at least the first half of 2024, steadily increasing towards mid-30 per month by YE; 787 production rate in the low-to-mid single-digits throughout 2024, mid-single digits in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Deliveries: low-400s 737MAX during 2024, increasing to mid-500s in 2025; 787 deliveries around 75 in 2024, 100 in 2025, and above 100 in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Aircraft Inventory: approximately half of 737MAX inventory and 787 inventory is liquidated during 2024, with nearly all of the remaining liquidated in 2025; some inventory deliveries could be pushed to 2026 related to MAX-7 and MAX-10 certification timing and uncertainty;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BDS/BGS Revenues: BDS segment revenue up by low single-digits annually over the next few years; BGS segment revenue increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range annually through 2026-2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BCA operating margins: Negative in 2024, moving to breakeven or slightly positive in 2025 and steadily increasing through 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BDS operating margins: Around breakeven in 2024, moving slightly positive in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pension contributions: Remain around $800 million to $1 billion per year throughout the forecasted period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Working capital: Annual source of cash throughout the forecast; between 2024 and 2026, this is a result of 737MAX and 787 liquidations; in 2027 and 2028, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a liquidation of LRIP-built 777X as production increases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--R&D expense: Fluctuates around 4% of total sales throughout the forecasted period; capex remains around 2% of total sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a Stable Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrated progress towards liquidating 737MAX inventory to facilitate the closure of its shadow factories;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Achievement of 38/month run-rate 737MAX production and alleviation of <span class="companylink">FAA</span> concerns and failures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Progress towards operational improvement and integration of potential corporate actions that could enhance longer-term operations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Forecasted gross debt below $50B and EBITDA leverage below 4x by YE 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress towards operational normalization via reduced inventory and increased production;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrated commitment to gross debt reduction leading to total debt to EBITDA leverage at 3.0x or lower;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins at 3% or above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs, which contribute to sustained FCF margins below 2%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operational missteps and/or debt-funded acquisitions or share repurchases lead to sustained total debt to EBITDA leverage above 4x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity as sufficient compared to other capital intensive 'BBB' category companies, to-be-bolstered by the expected debt-issuance related to the Spirit transaction. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will maintain full revolver availability and aim to sustain greater than $10 billion of cash over the next few years. We do not expect the company to draw on its revolver, though it could reduce total capacity as operations improve heading into 2026-2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We currently expect this will be adequate to cover significant capital requirements and project that FCF will improve toward the high single-digit billion-dollar range in 2026-2027. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt structure is predominantly comprised of senior unsecured notes, revolvers and CP availability. The company has several maturities due over the next 27 months, totaling more than $12 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> is the world's largest aerospace & defense firm, and one of two major large commercial aircraft manufacturers, globally. The company operates in three principal segments: BDS; <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Aircraft; and BGSs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737MAX production challenges, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs, lower cash flows, and elevated leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-26 April 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has revised <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable. This action follows <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s comments around restoring its cash balance to $10 billion and staying ahead of maturities and liquidity needs over the next 12 months. The Outlook incorporates <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could issue new debt to de-risk early-2025 cash flow risks and bolster financial flexibility as the company works through operational milestones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 'BBB-' Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'F3' Short-term IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed the company's long-term unsecured notes and revolvers at 'BBB-' and CP program at 'F3'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Outlook reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s heightened execution risks over the next 12 to 24 months as it eliminates legacy inventory, stabilizes and increases aircraft production rates, navigates seasonal cash flow volatility, pursues additional corporate actions that should enhance longer-term operations and fulfills its commitment to repay debt and return to IG metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could stabilize the Outlook if <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> liquidates over 100 of its pre-2023 built 737 MAX and half of its 787 inventories by early 2025 and 737 MAX production increases toward 38 per month. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes these actions would alleviate operational strain and enable management to focus on the potential <span class="companylink">Spirit Aerosystems</span> integration in 1H25. These improvements will also provide a path towards operational normalization and production optimization, facilitating FCF acceleration, debt repayment and return to an IG financial profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 'BBB-' rating is supported by a $529 billion backlog (up about 30% during 2023), which provides several years of revenue visibility. The company is one of two major global aircraft manufacturers with substantial diversification to differentiate it from its largest competitor, particularly given its large defense and services businesses. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects the company will continue to generate positive annual FCF throughout its rating case with potential to approach double digit billions by the end of 2027 as operations normalize and operating margins improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Issuance Extends Elevated Leverage: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could issue new debt to de-risk 2025 liquidity needs based on the company's comments around restoring cash balances around $10 billion and staying ahead of liquidity needs over the next 12 months. The use of proceeds would be to provide a cushion against expected annual Q1 FCF seasonality ahead of upcoming maturities. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects near-term leverage will remain well outside of its 4.0x negative sensitivity in 2024 and 2025 but will return inside by approximately YE 2026 before further declining below 3.0x by YE 2027 as a result of a combination of gross debt repayment over the two-year period and production- and efficiency-linked operating margin improvements. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes a potential all-debt-funded acquisition of <span class="companylink">Spirit</span> is captured within the Negative Outlook and that the debt issuance provides incremental financial flexibility during a period of heightened operational execution risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the near-term financial pressures from incremental debt and expected capital investment will be mostly offset by the near-term focus on inventory reduction and production optimization and longer-term synergies if <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> takes control of <span class="companylink">Spirit</span>. The fuselages that <span class="companylink">Spirit</span> produces effectively set the pace of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s production line, and having greater control and visibility into timing and quality of the input will better allow <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to stabilize and normalize production rates, and plan for future increases. Since the transaction is not likely to close sooner than six to nine months after a potential announcement, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the majority of the known quality control concerns related to the 737MAX will be in the process of being evaluated and alleviated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational Challenges Temper FCF: Investment and working capital fluctuations, coupled with heightened execution risks around 2024-25 operational objectives, will likely result in weaker 2024 and 2025 FCF than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> previously expected. However, forecasted positive margin trends in the <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment will accelerate FCF and deleveraging capacity heading into 2026, little changed from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s March 2024 review. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s FCF should then approach the double digit billion-dollar level after the company liquidates its remaining aircraft inventory and shuts down its shadow factories, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently projects to be largely completed by YE 2025, subject to MAX-7 and -10 certification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FAA Investigation Disruptive but Manageable: The <span class="companylink">FAA</span> recently completed a quality control audit of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s production processes following the January 2024 incident involving an <span class="companylink">Alaska Airlines</span> flight. The investigation resulted in greater operational disruption and slower 737MAX production than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> previously anticipated during the first few months of 2024. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has until late-May 2024 to develop a plan to address the various concerns and failures highlighted by the <span class="companylink">FAA</span>, during which time <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will continue to operate at a slower production pace in line with early 2024 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Deliveries Update: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts around low-400s 737MAX deliveries in 2024 and expects the production rate to remain constrained below 20 per month for 1H, steadily rising towards the mid-30s by the end of the year. We further forecast the company will liquidate slightly more than half of its approximately 200 737 MAX aircraft in inventory by YE 2024. We also forecast around 75 787 aircraft deliveries during the year, with low-to-mid single digit production per month and liquidation of around 30 out of 60 787 aircraft in inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$520+ Billion Backlog Provides Visibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s multi-year and growing backlog to be one of the key positive considerations when evaluating the company's business profile. As of December 2023, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a total backlog of over $520 billion, approximately $120 billion higher than the previous year. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the commercial airplanes backlog of $440 billion represents greater than seven years of revenue at <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-projected 2025-2026 production levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Defense and Services Bolsters Diversification: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span> (BDS) and <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS) segments as net positives for the company due to the high degree of diversification provided by contract, program and capability. Independently, BDS would represent a top-five global defense contractor, by revenue. The segment also operates in a variety of high priority areas such as space, drones and aircraft, which should remain key focus areas for the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> over the next several years. Meanwhile, BGS provides steady margins and cash flows in addition to stability from aftermarket sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated three notches below its most immediate peer, <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Stable). This is largely the result of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s execution challenges in the past several years, which have combined to weaken its quantitative rating factors compared with <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. In the past, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved significantly better FCF and funds from operations due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737MAX grounding and subsequent disruptions severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow and caused debt to rise significantly versus <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense, in addition to services. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> currently has a stronger balance sheet, though <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> plans to use nearly all excess cash to repay debt. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> generally operates with a net cash position, though both companies have significant financial flexibility. Foreign exchange exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> has taken modest actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> issues new debt to, bolster financial flexibility and de-risk liquidity and refinance needs ahead of expected seasonal cash outflows in early-2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Revenue/FCF: Overall revenue up low-single-digits in 2024, double-digits in 2025, 2026 and 2027; FCF breakeven-to-positive in 2024, low-single digit billions in 2025 and high single-digits in 2026 and 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Production rates: 737MAX production rate remains constrained during at least the first half of 2024, steadily increasing towards mid-30 per month by year-end; 787 production rate in the low-to-mid single-digits throughout 2024, mid-single digits in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Deliveries: low-400s 737MAX during 2024, increasing to mid-500s in 2025; 787 deliveries around 75 in 2024, 100 in 2025, and above 100 in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Aircraft Inventory: approximately half of 737MAX inventory and 787 inventory is liquidated during 2024, with nearly all of the remaining liquidated in 2025; some inventory deliveries could be pushed to 2026 related to MAX-7 and -10 certification timing and uncertainty;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BDS/BGS Revenues: BDS segment revenue up by low single-digits annually over the next few years; BGS segment revenue increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range annually through 2026-2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BCA operating margins: Negative in 2024, moving to breakeven or slightly positive in 2025 and steadily increasing through 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BDS operating margins: Around breakeven in 2024, moving slightly positive in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pension contributions: Remain around $800 million to $1 billion per year throughout the forecasted period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Working capital: Annual source of cash throughout the forecast; between 2024 and 2026, this is a result of 737 MAX and 787 liquidations; in 2027 and 2028, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assumes a liquidation of LRIP-built 777X as production increases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--R&D expense: Fluctuates around 4% of total sales throughout the forecasted period; capex remains around 2% of total sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a Stable Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrated progress towards liquidating 737MAX inventory to facilitate the closure of its shadow factories;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Achievement of 38/month run-rate 737MAX production and alleviation of <span class="companylink">FAA</span> concerns and failures;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Progress towards operational improvement and integration of potential corporate actions that could enhance longer-term operations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Forecasted gross debt below $50B and EBITDA leverage below 4x by YE 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress towards operational normalization via reduced inventory and increased production;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrated commitment to gross debt reduction leading to total debt to EBITDA leverage at 3.0x or lower;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins at 3% or above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs, which contribute to sustained FCF margins below 2%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operational missteps and/or debt-funded acquisitions or share repurchases lead to sustained total debt to EBITDA leverage above 4x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity as sufficient compared to other capital intensive 'BBB' category companies, to-be-bolstered by the expected debt-issuance related to the Spirit transaction. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will maintain full revolver availability and aim to sustain greater than $10 billion of cash over the next few years. We do not expect the company to draw on its revolver, though it could reduce total capacity as operations improve heading into 2026-2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We currently expect this will be adequate to cover significant capital requirements and project that FCF will improve toward the high single-digit billion-dollar range in 2026-2027. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt structure is predominantly comprised of senior unsecured notes, revolvers and CP availability. The company has several maturities due over the next 27 months, totaling more than $12 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> is the world's largest aerospace & defense firm, and one of two major large commercial aircraft manufacturers, globally. The company operates in three principal segments: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span>; <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Aircraft; and <b>Boeing</b> Global Services.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> made certain analytical adjustments to add-back one-time charges related to various defense programs, the 787 aircraft and 737 MAX aircraft.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX production challenges, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs, lower cash flows, and elevated leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-15 March 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, NYSE: BA) 'BBB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'F3' Short-Term IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed the company's senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB-' and short-term CP ratings at 'F3'. The Rating Outlook was revised to Stable from Positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Outlook revision reflects <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s path to reach its positive triggers (including sub-3.0x leverage, high single digit billion FCF and greater than $15 billion of debt repayment) will likely be delayed by around 12 months from <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s prior expectations, to 2026 from 2025. This delay would mainly be due to unexpected operational disruptions and the potential for additional corporate actions that should enhance longer-term operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts between 420-450 737MAX deliveries in 2024, approximately 100 lower than prior forecasts. We expect the production rate to remain constrained below 38 per month for the majority of 2024 and the company will liquidate approximately half of its inventory by year-end. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 2024 FCF will be in the low single-digit billion range, likely limiting near-term deleveraging capacity and leading to leverage above 3.0x until 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 'BBB-' rating and Stable Outlook continue to be supported by the company's over $520 billion backlog (up about 30% during 2023), which provides several years of revenue visibility. The company is one of two major global aircraft manufacturers with substantial diversification to differentiate it from its largest competitor, particularly given its large defense and services businesses. Additionally, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects the company will continue to generate positive FCF with potential to increase substantially approaching double digit billions as operations normalize and operating margins improve over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FAA Investigation Disruptive, but Manageable: The <span class="companylink">FAA</span> recently completed a quality control audit of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s production processes following the January 2024 incident involving an <span class="companylink">Alaska Airlines</span> flight. The investigation resulted in greater operational disruption and slower 737MAX production than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> previously anticipated during the first few months of 2024. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has until late-May 2024 to develop a plan to address the various concerns and failures highlighted by the <span class="companylink">FAA</span>, during which time <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will continue to operate at a slower production pace in line with early 2024 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low-Single Digit 2024 FCF Delays Deleveraging Plans: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s FCF in the low single-digit billion-dollar range during 2024 and in the mid-to-high single digits in 2025 and 2026. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the company will continue to be negatively impacted by slower aircraft inventory reduction in the near-term coupled with a near-term build-up of parts and components as the company aims to support the supply chain. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects negative operating margins for the commercial airplanes segment in 2024 due to an expected negative drag in 1Q24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes positive margin in the <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment will accelerate FCF and deleveraging capacity heading into 2026. We anticipate near-term debt paydown will likely be limited to maturities as they become due in 2024 and 2025, until production rates stabilize and the company liquidates its aircraft inventory. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current rating case forecasts 2025 and 2026 EBITDA leverage of low-to-mid 4x and mid-to-high-2x, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >$520+ Billion Backlog Provides Visibility: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s multi-year and growing backlog to be one of the key positive considerations when evaluating the company's business profile. As of December 2023, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a total backlog of over $520 billion, approximately $120 billion higher than the previous year. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the commercial airplanes backlog of $440 billion represents greater than seven years of revenue at <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-projected 2025-2026 production levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Defense and Services Bolsters Diversification: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span> (BDS) and <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS) segments as net positives for the company due to the high degree of diversification provided by contract, program and capability. Independently, BDS would represent a top-five global defense contractor, by revenue. The segment also operates in a variety of high priority areas such as space, drones and aircraft, which should remain key focus areas for the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> over the next several years. Meanwhile, BGS provides steady margins and cash flows in addition to stability from aftermarket sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated three notches below its most immediate peer, <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Stable). This is largely the result of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s execution challenges in the past several years, which have combined to weaken its quantitative rating factors compared with <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. In the past, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved significantly better FCF and funds from operations due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737MAX grounding and subsequent disruptions severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow and caused debt to rise significantly versus <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense, in addition to services. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> currently has a stronger balance sheet, though <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> plans to use nearly all excess cash to repay debt. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> generally operates with a net cash position, though both companies have significant financial flexibility. Foreign exchange exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> has taken modest actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions for the issuer include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Overall revenue up high-single-digits in 2024, double-digits in 2025 and 2026; FCF in the low-single digit billions in 2024, mid-single digit billions in 2025 and high single digits in 2026 and 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Production rates: 737MAX production rate remains constrained during at least the first half of 2024, steadily increasing towards 38 per month by year-end; 787 production rate in the mid-single digits throughout 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Deliveries: between 420-450 737MAX during 2024, increasing to mid-500s in 2025; 787 deliveries around 85-95 in 2024 and 2025, and above 100 in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Aircraft Inventory: approximately half of 737MAX inventory and greater than half of 787 inventory is liquidated during 2024, with nearly all of the remaining liquidated in 2025, excluding approximately 35 737MAX pushed to 2026 related to MAX-7 and -10 certifications;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span> (BDS) segment revenue up by low-to-mid single-digits annually over the next few years; <b>Boeing</b> Global Services segment revenue increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range annually through 2026-2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BCA operating margins negative mid-single digits in 2024, moving slightly positive in 2025 and steadily increasing through 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BDS operating margins around breakeven in 2024, moving slightly positive in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--All debt paydown in 2024-2025 coming from paying maturities as they come due; some flexibility to make voluntary debt reduction in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pension contributions remain around $1 billion per year throughout the forecasted period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Working capital is an annual source of cash through 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--R&D expense fluctuates around 4% of total sales throughout the forecasted period; capex remains around 2% of total sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress towards operational normalization via reduced inventory and increased production;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrated commitment to gross debt reduction leading to total debt to EBITDA leverage at 3.0x or lower;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins at 3% or above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs, which contribute to sustained FCF margins below 2% beyond 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operational missteps and/or debt-funded acquisitions or share repurchases lead to sustained total debt to EBITDA leverage above 4.0x beyond 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity as sufficient compared to other capital intensive 'BBB' category companies. As of YE 2023 the company maintained total liquidity of greater than $26 billion, comprised of cash and equivalents around $16 billion and full availability of its $10 billion unsecured revolver. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will continue to hold greater than $10 billion of cash and equivalents over the forecasted horizon, and we do not expect the company to draw on its revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We currently expect this will be adequate to cover significant capital requirements, particularly since Fitch-projected FCF will improve towards the high-single digit billion-dollar range in 2026. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt structure is predominantly comprised of senior unsecured notes, revolvers and CP availability. The company has several maturities due over the next 27 months, totaling more than $12 billion, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently expects will be repaid using internally generated cash and cash on hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> is the world's largest aerospace & defense firm, and one of two major large commercial aircraft manufacturers, globally. The company operates in three principal segments: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span>; <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Aircraft; and <b>Boeing</b> Global Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Summary of Financial Adjustments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> made certain analytical adjustments to add-back one-time charges related to various defense programs, the 787 aircraft and 737 MAX aircraft.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs, lower cash flows, and elevated leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York/Chicago-09 January 2024:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The grounding of the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 737 MAX 9 is expected to be neutral to ratings and have limited near-term effects on Fitch-rated aircraft lessors, airlines and ABS, given relatively low exposure to the aircraft model and a fairly clear pathway for corrective action, <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Following the in-air door detachment on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, the <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Authority</span> (<span class="companylink">FAA</span>) issued an airworthiness directive requiring safety inspections of certain <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 737 MAX 9 aircraft equipped with the mid-cabin door plug before returning to flight. Subsequently, the <span class="companylink">FAA</span> outlined an approved method for operators to comply with the directive, which should expedite the requisite inspections and any corrective actions needed for affected aircraft to resume service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The airworthiness directive applies only to the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 737 MAX 9 aircraft with the mid-cabin door plug for configurations with fewer than 180 seats. No other <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 737 MAX type or current generation B737-900 aircraft is subject to the grounding. The groundings will contribute to the overall scarcity of aircraft supply, further supporting residual values on current technology aircraft already buoyed by delivery delays from <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Collectively, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-rated lessors? exposure to the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 737 MAX 9 aircraft totaled 1.2% (or 57 aircraft) by count and 1.5% (or $2.7 billion by market value) as of Jan. 8, 2024. Of this exposure, the FAA?s airworthiness directive applied to only 47 of these aircraft, or $2.2 billion by market value.</p>

                     Aircraft Lessors Exposure[https://e.infogram.com/92672ebf-a565-489d-9e9f-63baf7020cbd?src=embed]
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rated lessors have $17.2 billion of senior unsecured debt coming due in 2024 and $19.7 billion of purchase commitments, with currently-strong liquidity coverage ratios expected to normalize gradually as debt maturities come due and order book commitments are filled. While aircraft lessors actively issued secured debt in 2023, they are expected to seek to increase unsecured issuance in 2024 to maintain funding flexibility and strong unencumbered asset coverage.</p>

                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >despite the near-term execution risks as the company completes mandatory inspections to affected aircraft while navigating existing objectives. We do not expect material production cancellations, particularly due to the low percentage of the overall orderbook that the 737 MAX 9 represents. We forecast <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>?s financial results to be slightly weaker in 2024 than we contemplated during our October 2023 review. However, we still expect the company to progress toward operational normalization over the next 18 to 24 months by gradually increasing 737 MAX and 787 production levels and liquidating aircraft in inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Within Fitch-rated airlines, exposure to the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 737 MAX 9 is limited to <span class="companylink">Alaska Air</span> (BB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> (B+/Stable). Grounded aircraft account for roughly 18% of Alaska?s mainline fleet and nearly 9% of United?s. Although the aircraft model makes up a sizable portion of both airlines? fleets and the grounding will create operational headaches, we do not anticipate the financial impact will drive rating actions at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Early information indicates that the grounding may be relatively short-lived, and both United and Alaska have sufficient financial flexibility to weather the disruption. The grounding also comes at a low point in the year for travel. A longer-term grounding would complicate operations, but also likely entail greater compensation from <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> rates two enhance equipment trust certificate (EETC) transactions with exposure to the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 737 MAX 9, namely United?s 2019-1 and 2018-1 series. We do not anticipate a material impact to collateral coverage for the transactions, as long-term value retention for the aircraft is unlikely to be affected by the incident, barring the discovery of a larger, systemic design flaw, which we view as unlikely. The aircraft type accounts for roughly 20% of the total collateral value for each transaction. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>-rated aircraft operating lease ABS transactions have no exposure to the aircraft.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York/Chicago-08 January 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> believes <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>?s (BA) credit profile remains on a positive trajectory despite the recent grounding of more than 170 737 MAX-9 aircraft following an incident on an <span class="companylink">Alaska Airlines</span> flight on Jan. 5, 2024. The <span class="companylink">FAA</span> has since approved a method to inspect affected aircraft, which provides a glidepath toward resolving the grounding, though the overall timing and inspection cost ahead of full return-to-service is uncertain and subject to no further expansion of the airworthiness directive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> continues to view BA?s path to reach its 2025 targets -- including sub-3.0x leverage, high single-digit billion FCF and greater than $15 billion of debt repayment -- as achievable, but likely non-linear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently rates <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>?s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and issue ratings on its unsecured debt ?BBB-?, and its short-term IDR and CP ratings at ?F3?. The Rating Outlook is Positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Near-term execution risks could be temporarily heightened as the company completes mandatory inspections to affected aircraft while navigating existing objectives. We forecast 2024 financial results will be slightly weaker than we contemplated during our October 2023 review. However, we still expect the company to remain on the same positive track and progress toward operational normalization over the next 18 to 24 months by gradually increasing 737MAX and 787 production levels and liquidating aircraft in inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We have updated our base case forecast to reflect 2024 MAX deliveries of around approximately 575 (versus previous near-600). This adjustment accounts for the possibility that the planned production rate increases to above 38 aircraft per month for the MAX could be marginally delayed due to a shift in operational priority, but with less of a disruption to production rates than those related to 2023 supply chain issues. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also projects BA could deliver between 10-15 fewer 737MAX aircraft as a result of the grounding, due in part to less inventory reduction than previously anticipated as affected airlines complete inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts 2024 FCF around the mid-to-high $4 billion range (versus previous the expectation of mid-$5 billion), which incorporates <span class="companylink">FAA</span>-mandated inspection costs, potential customer compensation, lower deliveries and the working capital impact from less inventory reduction. Our assumption regarding inventory liquidation reflects that the majority of aircraft are (or were previously) earmarked to be delivered to China and are likely 737MAX-8 variants, which are unaffected by the grounding. An expansion of the airworthiness directive would further weigh on FCF and deleveraging capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not expect material cancellations as a result of the issue, particularly due to the low percentage of the overall orderbook that the MAX-9 represents. We believe the high switching costs for airlines to change fleet plans, coupled with the time-to-delivery for new aircraft orders also insulates BA from material cancellations. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates the MAX-9 represents less than 5% of BA?s total backlog and a low-single-digit percentage of aircraft inventory to be liquidated (approximately 200 total 737 MAX aircraft in inventory).</p>

</div><div>3629 words</div><div>3 October 2023</div><div>Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary</div><div>FITRA</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2023 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-03 October 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BA or <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>) 'BBB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'F3' Short-Term IDR. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed BA's senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB-' and short-term CP ratings at 'F3'. The Rating Outlook was revised to Positive from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Positive Outlook reflects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s declining inventory levels, improving production and delivery profile, growing backlog, and forecasted positive FCF that will facilitate debt repayment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> recognizes that recent supplier missteps will modestly delay previously expected operational and financial improvements, but expects ongoing progress to lead to operational normalization and greater than $15 billion of gross debt repayment by YE 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case forecasts positive FCF of around $2 billion in 2023 steadily increasing towards $10 billion in 2025, which supports EBITDA leverage declining below 3.0x by 2025. The Outlook is anticipated to be resolved in the next 12 months-18 months as the company de-risks its return to operational normalization and progresses towards its debt reduction targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF Approaching $10 billion by 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects BA's FCF will improve to nearly $10 billion in 2025, up from around $2 billion forecasted in 2023, as the company gradually liquidates aircraft in inventory and normalizes operations by scaling 737MAX and 787 production rates. The company should also benefit from EBITDA margin improvement to above 10% in the next 12 months to 18 months as facility utilization improves alongside inventory reduction. The <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span> (BDS) segment should also transition to breakeven-to-positive margins as challenged programs mature, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts will begin during 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBITDA Leverage Declining Below 3.0x: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts BA's EBITDA leverage will decline below 3.0x by YE 2025 as a result of greater than $15 billion of estimated debt repayment in conjunction with utilization-driven EBITDA margin improvement. More than $9 billion of debt repayment would come from retiring debt at maturity and the agency calculates the company could have up to an additional $8 billion of capacity to make voluntary prepayments while maintaining cash above $10 billion. The timing and pace of voluntary repayments depends on BA's ability to reduce inventoried aircraft and ramp aircraft production rates on-schedule, while also considering seasonal liquidity needs. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers these concerns to be addressable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Inventory Liquidation Facilitates Operational Normalization: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects BA will monetize all 737MAX and 787 aircraft currently in inventory by the end of 2025 despite supplier challenges in the first nine months of 2023. The agency forecasts approximately 200 MAXs and 60 787s in inventory at the end of 2023, declining to 80 and 20, respectively, in 2024 before being liquidated in 2025. These projections are slower than <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> previously expected, but the agency recognized operational risks remained. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views inventory liquidation as instrumental to operational normalization and long-term FCF generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Production Increasing, Non-Linear Path Expected: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts BA will steadily increase production rates for 737MAX and 787 aircraft over the next 24 months towards run-rate levels of 50 MAXs and 10 787s per month by early 2026. The agency believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> should be able to manage the operational and financial impacts of future supplier challenges, if any, as MAX inventory levels and production rates normalize and supply chains are optimized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Risks to production rate increases and inventory reduction include supply chain constraints which are expected to persist throughout 2024 and operational missteps by one of the company's key suppliers, <span class="companylink">Spirit Aerosystems</span>. Disruptions have resulted in periodic but temporary delivery delays, particularly for the 737MAX. The bulk of issues have challenged inventory liquidation rather than new aircraft production due to increased inspections and rework requirements during maintenance cycles. These challenges will likely limit 2023 FCF and profitability growth compared to previous forecasts, due largely to slower inventory reduction coupled with increased maintenance work scope. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes BA's trajectory remains positive, with a clear line of sight to operational normalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Orders, Backlog Provide Demand, Revenue Visibility: Global demand for new aircraft is substantial, indicated by greater than $360 billion of backlog in BA's <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> estimates current aircraft backlog provides visibility into sales through early-2029. We expect the company will continue to generate substantial new orders over the next several years as airlines aim to modernize aging fleets and alleviate capacity constraints that currently exist in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >China will also be a significant industry growth driver over the next few decades as it builds up its air infrastructure. Recent headwinds for the 737MAX in the APAC region have mostly dissipated and BA estimates 97% of the MAX fleet is now back in service in China. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the company will be able to restart deliveries to the area over the next several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Defense Bolsters Diversification: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views BA's BDS segment as a net positive factor for the credit due to the high degree of diversification provided by contract, program and capability. Independently, BDS would represent a top-5 global defense contractor, by revenue. The segment also operates in a variety of high priority areas such as space, drones and aircraft, which should remain key focus areas for the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> over the next several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the company will remain competitive for new programs, such as (one of the two) Next Generation Air Dominance programs, which includes a drone component where BA specializes. BDS is also supported by strong international demand and heightened global tensions, with greater than 30% of defense revenue coming from non-U.S. customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Defense Program Challenges Expected to Moderate: Despite being a net positive for BA's overall credit profile, BDS has experienced operational challenges on four large contracts which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects will collectively contribute to a drag on free cash flow through at least the end of 2024. These four significant programs, which represent around 25% of BDS sales, have driven segment margins to be negative over the past 18 months and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes they will remain a margin headwind and cash drag until YE 2024 after two of the programs pass major milestones. We conservatively expect the segment will remain around breakeven through the end of 2025 as a result of persistent risk from the remaining two programs being offset by operational improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated three notches below its most immediate peer, <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Stable). This is largely the result of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s execution challenges in the past several years, which have combined to weaken <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s quantitative rating factors compared with <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. In the past, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved significantly better FCF and funds from operations due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737MAX grounding and 787 disruption severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow, and caused debt to rise significantly versus <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense, in addition to services. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> currently has a stronger balance sheet, though BA plans to use all excess cash to repay debt. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> generally operates with a net cash position, though both companies have significant financial flexibility. Foreign exchange exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> has taken modest actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s Key Assumptions for the issuer include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Double-digit overall revenue growth in 2023 supported by significant growth at the <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes segment; 737MAX deliveries increase to around 405 in 2023 and 787 deliveries around 70; overall 2024 revenue grows by greater than 25% as a result of higher production levels and inventory reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span> (BDS) segment revenue flattish in 2023, increases by single digits in 2024 and 2025; <b>Boeing</b> Global Services segment revenue increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range annually through 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--737MAX production rates: increases to 38 per month by the end of 2023, low-40s in mid-2024, high-40s in early 2025 and run-rate around 50-52 by YE 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--737MAX inventory: around 200 remain in inventory at YE 2023, between 60% and 70% of those aircraft are delivered during 2024, remaining delivered in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--787 production rates: Three per month until Q4 2023 when they increase to four per month; increase to 5 per month in 1H24, seven per month in 1H25 and 10 per month by YE 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--787 inventory: approx. 65-70 remain in inventory at YE 2023, between 60% and 70% of those aircraft are delivered during 2024 and remaining are delivered in 1H25;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BDS operating margins negative in 2023 and 2024, increasing towards breakeven in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Generally, all cash in excess of around $10 billion to $12 billion will be directed towards debt repayment before YE 2025, with some exception in case of liquidity needs and seasonality in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pension contributions remain around $1 billion per year throughout the forecasted period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Working capital is an annual source of cash through 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--R&D expense fluctuates around 4% of total sales throughout the forecasted period; capex remains around 2% of total sales;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Fuselage and aft pressure bulkhead fixes result in a cash drag, spread between 2023 through 2024 as a result of inspections, increased work scope, operational disruption and modest conservatism for unforeseen future costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Defense program cost overruns result in cash drag between 2023 and 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress towards operational normalization via reduced inventory and increased production;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Demonstrated commitment to gross debt reduction leading to total debt to EBITDA leverage at 3.0x or lower;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins at 3% or above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs, which contribute to sustained FCF margins below 2% beyond 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operational missteps and/or debt-funded acquisitions or share repurchases lead to sustained total debt to EBITDA leverage above 4.0x beyond 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> could stabilize the outlook as a result of persistent operational delays which result in a delay of FCF generation and EBITDA leverage improvement inside BA's positive sensitivities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views BA's liquidity as sufficient and strong compared to capital intensive 'BBB' category companies. As of mid-2023 BA maintained total liquidity of greater than $23 billion, comprised of cash and equivalents in excess of $13 billion and full availability of its recently extended $10 billion unsecured revolver. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the company will continue to hold greater than $10 billion of cash over the forecasted horizon and we do not expect BA to draw on its revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We expect this will be adequate to cover any significant capital requirements, particularly as <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects the company's FCF will improve towards $10 billion in 2025. The company's debt structure is predominantly comprised of senior unsecured notes, revolvers and CP availability. The company has several maturities due over the next 36 months, totaling more than $17 billion, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently expects the company to repay using internally generated cash and cash on hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BA) is the world's largest aerospace & defense firm, and one of two major large commercial aircraft manufacturers, globally.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

The manner of Fitch?s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch?s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>

                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-28 September 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has withdrawn <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span>'s (BCC) 'BBB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). At the time of the withdrawal, the Rating Outlook was Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has withdrawn BCC's ratings as the rated entity no longer exists and all of its outstanding senior unsecured debt has been paid in full. Accordingly, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for BCC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Prior to the withdrawal, BCC's ratings and Outlook reflected the linkage with that of its parent, <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BA), and the fact that BA has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition to the guarantee, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support the sale of BA's products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, BA's track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further supported <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of BCC as a core subsidiary of BA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consistent with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings and Outlooks of core subsidiaries were equalized with those of its parent. BCC's unsecured debt rating were also equalized to the Long-Term IDR of the parent, reflecting the unconditional guarantee.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-London-21 September 2023: A solid recovery in air traffic, expanded commercial airlines? fleet-modernisation programmes, as well as increased defence spending spurred by geopolitical events, support order growth in the EMEA aerospace and defence (A&D) sector, <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The commercial aerospace recovery is helped by airlines? growing traffic, the need to modernise ageing fleets with more fuel-efficient units, and improving airline profitability. We expect deliveries in the sector to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels by end-2025. Within the sector, the narrow-body segment has been growing faster, although its growth in 2022 was slower than expected. Full recovery of the wide-body segment is likely to take until 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     Aircraft deliveries[https://e.infogram.com/f5cc8a1a-90a0-47e9-8f10-35037534b556?src=embed]
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Our outlook for the A&D sector is ?Improving?. However, we now expect growth in aircraft deliveries by <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> in 2023 to be in low-teen percentages compared to our expectation of about 20% at the start of the year. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to deliver slightly less than 600 aircraft in 2023, including 425-460 of the 737 MAX. We now expect a lower proportion of 737 MAX deliveries in 2023 to be from inventory following the <span class="companylink">Spirit Aerosystems</span> fuselage issue that will require the rework of inventoried aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     Aircraft order and backlog[https://e.infogram.com/a8bb591b-726e-4c8a-a6b8-6545046bccfc?src=embed]
                  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We expect that production and delivery rates for European commercial aerospace companies will remain constrained by supply-chain disruptions until at least mid-2024. Such pressures have eased from their peak in 2021 but have persisted for longer than expected. Supply-chain bottlenecks have been registered in several parts of the aircraft value chain. Key pressure points relate to the shortage of parts such as engines, forgings and electrical components. Aircraft manufacturers and suppliers are also exposed to shortages of experienced engineers following job cuts during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A partial recall of some in-fleet GTF engines used primarily in the A320 family aircraft is the most recent setback in the commercial aerospace sector. This will likely affect the cash flow and liquidity of the programme?s minority European partners, <span class="companylink">MTU Aero Engines</span> and GKN Holdings, although the full impact of the recall</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >is yet to be assessed: https://app.fitchconnect.com/search/research/article/PR_10246388[https://app.fitchconnect.com/search/research/article/PR_10246388].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased defence spending, triggered in Europe by geopolitical events, including Russia?s war in Ukraine, is likely to support revenue for the vast majority of European A&D manufacturers and service providers. Orders rose significantly in 1H23 and we expect them to continue growing for most companies in the coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Still, some defence contractors will benefit sooner than others. Those companies that make munitions and armoured vehicles or provide related services, such as <span class="companylink">MBDA</span> and BAE, have already seen an increase in projected volumes. Companies focusing on longer-cycle equipment, such as fighter jets and submarines, will likely see a more pronounced benefit only in the later part of this decade. This includes the Eurofighter consortium, thyssenkrupp and <span class="companylink">Thales</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-19 October 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BA) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-' and Short-Term IDR and CP rating at 'F3'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also affirmed the Long-Term IDR and senior unsecured ratings of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span> (BCC) at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA's ratings and outlook reflect the company's improving FCF and leverage, progress towards reducing inventory and overcoming operational challenges, high degree of technology, and substantial liquidity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case forecasts positive FCF of about $5.5 billion in 2023 and $10 billion in 2024, with leverage metrics trending below 3.5x. The company also holds a strong, diversified, and strategic market position in both aerospace and defense end-markets, supported by a large order backlog and regulatory moat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concerns include elevated inventory levels and supply chain constraints which could influence timing of cash generation, production rate increases, and operational stabilization, as well as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s large debt balance, which leaves its rating exposed to adverse business or economic conditions until debt is reduced. The agency also recognizes headwinds including the return of the 737 MAX to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage Trending Below 3.5x: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates BA's leverage will continue to remain elevated for the rating level, around or above 3.5x, until YE 2024 as the company recovers from the worst downturn in aviation history and moves beyond several operational and regulatory challenges. However, metrics should improve thereafter as the company's operations continue to normalize towards run-rate levels, which should lead to greater cash generation, in tandem with the company's stated plan to use excess cash to pay down debt. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects the company could reduce debt by more than $20 billion by 2025 while still maintaining greater than $10 billion of available cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive FCF Forecasted: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects BA's FCF to gradually improve towards a level consistent with the high 'BBB' category over the next few years. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> forecasts BA will generate between $1 billion and $2 billion of FCF in 2022, between $5 billion and $7 billion in 2023, and low double-digit billions in 2024. The pace and magnitude of FCF increases will largely depend on balancing aircraft deliveries, inventory reduction, and production rate increases, while the health of the supply chain and demand by airline customers will heavily influence each of these factors. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> also believes BA's defense business could be a negative drag on cash flow over the next 12 months to 18 months as the company works through operational and growth challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deliveries Increasing: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case assumes large commercial aircraft (LCA) deliveries by BA will increase by more than 75% between 2021 and 2023, driven by strong narrowbody demand despite our expectation for a mild U.S. recession in 2023. Strong air traffic demand, particularly within the US, as well as higher OEM production rates, should help to extend BA's recovery in profitability, FCF generation and revenue growth. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes through-the-cycle demand will remain intact given the long-term planning of customers, as well as the resiliency of aircraft funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Supply Chain, Inventory Constrain Production: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes BA will temper increases to production rates until there is a high degree of confidence in the supply chain's ability to increase capacity. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s current base case for BA incorporates production rates for the 737 MAX increasing to the high-30s per month beginning in early-2024 from current 31 per month, then again to the low-40s in late 2024. These higher levels assume minimal supply chain disruption and steady inventory reduction. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects the 787 will be produced at a low-single digit rate through the end of 2023 before raising to mid-single digits in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Supply Chain Challenges Remain: Supply chain health, specifically related to current high-pressure points of labor, engines and spares, engine parts, semiconductors, and raw materials, will remain a key watch item as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> ramp up production rates beyond 2022. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the majority of companies have been prudently restocking inventory that was drawn down during the pandemic and we consider risk of near-term disruption to be minimal. However, prolonged supply chain constraints could lead to higher costs and a slower ramp-up of future production which could limit financial performance upside from current levels and BA's to generate significant FCF and delever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Inventory Reduction Ongoing: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes BA's ability to reduce the number of aircraft in inventory will be a key factor determining whether the company will be able to meet or exceed the agency's production and cash flow forecasts. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects BA will modestly reduce inventory in the final months of 2022, leaving balances of more than 250 737 MAX aircraft and more than 90 787s at the end of the year. We forecast the rate of reduction will likely hinge on a combination of the health and appetite of airline customers, and pace of production rate increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >China Unlikely a Near-term Impact: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes an agreement with China to recertify the 737 MAX is possible over the next three months to six months. However, we do not expect an agreement will have a meaningful effect on the company's financial performance and delivery numbers until "Zero Covid" policies are loosened, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> does not anticipate until mid-2023 or later. Geopolitical and trade tensions and global economic conditions are also key factors that could inhibit progress towards delivery resumption in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >LCA Competitive Position Weakened: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> still shares a valuable duopoly with <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, but its competitive position has weakened in the past three years. The MAX grounding allowed <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> to solidify its leadership in the narrowbody market. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> also stopped development of the New Midmarket Airplane. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s termination of the proposed Embraer joint venture gave <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> an edge at the smaller end of the narrowbody market with the A220 family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >MAX -7 and -10 Certification Uncertain: BA's 737 MAX-7 and MAX-10 variants must be certified before YE 2022 in order to avoid the need for either significant re-design and alterations of the aircraft or an extension of the certification process by <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects BA will likely reach alternate arrangements, particularly with the largest customers for the variants, if certification or extensions are not awarded; however, it is possible that some orders for could be in jeopardy of cancellation if an agreement is not reached. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> assesses a moderate likelihood that certification of the -7 variant is possible by the end of 2022, though the -10 will likely require a Congressional extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Positive Defense Environment, but Program Challenges: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> considers the overall environment for defense contracts to be positive. Spending on defense is expected to increase both within the U.S. and internationally over the next several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views BA's defense business to be a positive factor for the credit due to the high degree of diversification by both contract and program that the segment adds; however, the company has experienced operational challenges on a few large contracts which may contribute to a drag on free cash flow over at least into 2023. Specifically, the KC-46 and T-7A programs, among others, have taken substantial charges during 2022 and future cost overruns are possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital</span>:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The affirmation of BCC's ratings and Outlook reflect the linkage with that of its parent, BA, and the fact that BA has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition to the guarantee, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support the sale of BA's products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, BA's track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further support <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of BCC as a core subsidiary of BA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consistent with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings and Outlooks of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent. BCC's unsecured debt rating is also equalized to the Long-Term IDR of the parent, reflecting the unconditional guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC has historically exhibited sound operating performance, stable asset quality, and a sufficient liquidity profile, although its standalone credit risk profile would likely be lower than 'BBB-' given the cyclicality and residual value risk associated with the aircraft leasing business, the credit risk profile and concentration of BCC's lessees and its elevated leverage levels relative to standalone aircraft lessors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's operating income declined in 2022 due to lower net gains on the disposal or re-lease of assets and higher provision expenses. Operating performance is expected to remain pressured in the near-term resulting from portfolio run-off, slow paying customers and modest impairments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consistent with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings and Outlooks of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent. BCC's unsecured debt rating is also equalized to the Long-Term IDR of the parent, reflecting the unconditional guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s ratings have been materially impacted in part by self-inflicted operational challenges and international regulators' response related to 737 MAX and 787 production, maintenance, and training since 2019. Delays in MAX return to service, which was exacerbated by the pandemic and broad aviation downturn, and 787 production caused a meaningful drag on FCF and subsequent build-up in inventory, which must be unwound. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the company will be able to navigate these changes as the broader industry recovers, which could result in the ESG factor of '4' for Management Strategy being revised to a '3'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated two notches below its most immediate peer, <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (BBB+/F1/Stable). This is largely the result of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s execution challenges in the past several years, which have combined to weaken <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s quantitative rating factors compared with <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. In the past, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved significantly better FCF and funds from operations due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737 MAX grounding and 787 disruption severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow, and caused debt to rise significantly versus <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>'s because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense, in addition to services. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> currently has a stronger balance sheet, though BA plans to use all excess cash to repay debt. <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> generally operates with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. Foreign exchange exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although <span class="companylink">Airbus</span> has taken modest actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mild recession in mid-2023 results in BA taking a tempered approach to increasing production rates for the 737 MAX and 787, though demand for the aircraft remains relatively stable due to airlines' long-term fleet planning;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--MAX production rate continues at 31 per month until increasing to high 30s per month beginning in early-2024 and low-40s in mid-to-late 2024; 787 aircraft remains in the low single digit range in 2023, but increases to the mid-single digits in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Between 80 and 100 737 MAX aircraft sold out of inventory per year in 2023 and 2024; between 35 and 50 787 aircraft sold out of inventory during the same period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Defense segment margins remain low through 2023 due to cost overruns at key programs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Marginally positive FCF in 2022, improving to high single digit billions in 2023 and low double-digit billions in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--COVID restrictions remain relatively strict in China through mid-2023 and 737 MAX deliveries don't resume until at least 2H23;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Supply chain constraints remain relatively unchanged until at least early-to-mid 2023 before gradually improving; Modest drag on working capital in 2023 due to timing of payments and supply chain inefficiency;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Company maintains at least $10 billion cash balance plus full revolver availability over the forecasted period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--All cash in excess of $10 billion to $12 billion will be used to repay debt through 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained total debt to EBITDA leverage at 3.0x or lower;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins at 3% or above;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Continued progress towards operational normalization via reduced inventory and increased production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs, which contribute to sustained FCF margins below 2% beyond 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Operational missteps and/or debt-funded acquisitions or share repurchases lead to sustained total debt to EBITDA leverage above 4.0x beyond 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material provision of customer financing by BCC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's ratings and Outlook are linked to those of its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade would be limited to <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s view of BA's credit profile. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> cannot envisage a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade could be driven by a downgrade of BA's ratings or the early termination of the parent guarantee prior to the repayment of BCC's outstanding publicly issued debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The unsecured debt rating is primarily sensitive to changes in the Long-Term IDR of the parent, and would be expected to move in tandem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views BA's liquidity as sufficient and strong compared to many other 'BBB-' rated companies. As of mid-2022 BA maintained total liquidity of greater than $25 billion, comprised of a cash balance in excess of $13 billion and full revolver availability of $12 billion. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the company will continue to hold greater than $10 billion of cash over the forecasted horizon and we do not expect BA to draw on its revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We expect this will be adequate to cover any significant capital requirements, particularly as <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects the company will turn FCF positive during 2022. The company's debt structure is predominantly comprised of senior unsecured notes, revolvers and CP availability. The company has several maturities due over the next 36 months, totaling just under $15 billion, which <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects the company to repay using internally generated cash and cash on hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BA) is the world's largest aerospace & defense firm, founded in Seattle, WA in 1916. The company operates in four principal segments: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span>; <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Aircraft; <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> Global Services; and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

Fitch Ratings: <b>Boeing</b>'s Positive Rating Momentum Hinges on Operational Execution</span>
</div><div>1692 words</div><div>26 January 2022</div><div>Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary</div><div>FITRA</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2022 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-26 January 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> believes <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>; BA) could achieve positive rating momentum during 2H22 if it executes on certain operational objectives to de-risk the company's credit profile. In particular, the agency heavily weights BA's ability to meet 737MAX delivery targets during 2022, as well as the timing of 787 deliveries resuming. Fitch is also monitoring the pace of orders, production rate increases, inventory levels, and the company's continued positive FCF execution and commitment to further pay down its debt balance. Fitch currently rates <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch would consider <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> delivering more than 450 737MAXs during the year to be a key step towards positive ratings momentum. Meeting or exceeding this target would likely put the company on pace to reduce inventory levels by more than 70-100 during the year, given the company's current production rate of 26 per month, and plan to increase to 31 per month early in 2022. Fitch considers the recent directive issued by the <span class="companylink">Civil Aviation Administration of China</span> to be a favorable development, which could help BA meet its delivery goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, the agency views the resumption of 787 aircraft deliveries as a necessary achievement, as it would remove a material headwind against FCF generation. Production of the aircraft is currently paused, and execution on the logistical challenges to deliver current inventory and resume production is an important watch item. Future customer concessions or charges related to 787 delivery delays are possible; however, Fitch expects the impact on cash flow will be manageable once the aircraft are again cleared for delivery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's base case forecasts a return in delivery momentum on the 737MAX and 787 in the first half of the year, facilitating positive FCF in the $3 billion to $6 billion range for the full-year 2022. The company also has maturing and callable debt of roughly $5 billion in each 2022 and 2023, which provides a path for gross debt reduction. Fitch views management's willingness to allocate capital towards debt reduction as relatively strong given the alignment of debt and equity stakeholders' near-term priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Risks to the company's positive rating momentum include the vulnerability of the aviation market recovery, order cancellations, unforeseen and costly testing and rework requirements related to 787 deliveries resuming during 2022, operational disruptions, and supply chain issues. Another risk is the potential for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to deviate from its stated financial policy, but Fitch views this as less likely.</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>

<div id="hd" ><span class='enHeadline'>Fitch Revises <b>Boeing</b>'s Outlook to Stable; Affirms 'BBB-'/'F3' Ratings</span>
</div><div>5541 words</div><div>22 October 2021</div><div>Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary</div><div>FITRA</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-22 October 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BA) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-' and Short-Term IDR at 'F3'. Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term IDR and senior unsecured ratings of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span> (BCC) at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Outlook revision reflects developments over the past year in coronavirus vaccines, airline traffic recovery and the 737 MAX. These developments have narrowed the uncertainty in Fitch's forecasts. Combined with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity position, they have also reduced the likelihood of a downgrade. Additionally, they also offset 787 delivery delays and a slow MAX delivery ramp-up, which are contributing to 2021 financial performance below some of Fitch's expectations. Going forward, Fitch believes that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is past its peak debt level and mostly through the cash burn trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors supporting the ratings include <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s strategic positions, diversification, technology, liquidity, access to the debt and equity markets, and a large order backlog. The relative stability of the defense business also supports the ratings. Substantial cost reductions should help mitigate pressures on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Concerns include <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s large debt balance, which leaves its rating exposed to adverse business or economic conditions until debt is reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Recertification</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In the past year, the 737 MAX program's credit risks have lessened, supporting the Outlook revision. Since the first recertification in November 2020, flying has been allowed in more than 175 countries and the number of passenger flights has exceeded 125,000. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has delivered approximately 200 MAX aircraft, and customers have placed about 650 gross orders. Fitch estimates the program's current order backlog covers 5-6 years of deliveries, and the backlog is up slightly from year-end 2020. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and the <span class="companylink">US Department of Justice</span> reached a 737 MAX settlement in early 2021, with financial terms lower than Fitch's expectations. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> also continued to pay down its MAX concessions and considerations to customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Notwithstanding the progress, Fitch sees several ongoing 737 MAX disappointments. The pace of deliveries has been slower than Fitch expected, partly due to the delay in China's recertification, which Fitch now expects will take place in late 2021 or early 2022. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s inventory reduction has also been slower than expected, and Fitch expects the inventory will be burned off during 2022 and possibly into 2023. Fitch believes there is a risk the production increase to 31/month could be delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >COVID-19 Pandemic: Early Stages of Airline Recovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The previous Rating Outlook had incorporated the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector, but the sector has made steady progress on a recovery, supporting the revision to Stable. Since Fitch downgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> in late October 2020, multiple vaccines have been approved for use, and the WHO reports that nearly 6.4 billion does have been administered as of early October. The vaccines have driven an initial recovery in airline traffic. Further recovery will be spurred by continued vaccine roll-out, the lifting of international travel restrictions and global GDP growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's base case for airline passenger traffic (domestic and international) assumes revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) will not recover to 2019 levels before YE 2023, and for a full year until 2024, and Fitch expects the recovery will be uneven by type of travel and region. Fitch expects capacity (available seat kilometers, ASKs) to recover before RPKs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The global airline industry still has years to go before returning to pre-pandemic levels. The damage to airline balance sheets will affect the industry for years, exposing it to the risks of another shock. Fitch assumes a disconnect for several years between the typical relationship between global GDP and traffic growth, with traffic lagging GDP due to travel hesitancy and restrictions, plus some additional impact from reduced business travel and ESG concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >787 Production Quality Issues and Delivery Delays</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The 787 program delivery delays partly offset the benefits from the ongoing recoveries with the MAX and global airlines. These delays are related to quality issues at both <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and some suppliers, and they have persisted for more than a year. In the last twelve months, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has delivered only 18 787's. This compares with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s production rate of 14 per month at the beginning of 2020. The lack of deliveries has negatively affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial results in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has an inventory of approximately 100 787's, some of which require rework before delivery. Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is subject to some contractual penalties because of the delays, and there is also cancelation risk. Additionally, there is a growing risk of a reach-forward loss, although this non- cash charge would not likely affect ratings by itself. Fitch's forecasts assume deliveries resume in the fourth quarter, although a further delay into early 2022 would not likely affect ratings. Fitch estimates deliveries could be abnormally high in 2022, before dropping in 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes the 787 situation is not as serious as the 737 MAX crisis. The 787 is not grounded, and it appears to be one of the most used widebody aircraft during the pandemic. Also, the quality issues do not appear to be safety-related. In addition, order cancelations have been modest, and there have been some new orders so far in 2021. Fitch's discussions with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 787 customers indicate the airlines still want the aircraft, although the depressed long-haul market eases near-term pressures for additional 787 capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Restructuring and Cost Reductions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has reduced its cost base during the coronavirus downturn, and Fitch believes the cost reductions have started to affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s results, including 2021 cash flow. The reductions include several voluntary and involuntary layoff programs, real estate footprint reductions, and consolidation of 787 production to one location (North Charleston). So far, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has taken severance charges covering 19,000 workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Commercial Airplane Competitive Position</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> still shares a valuable duopoly with Airbus, but its competitive position has weakened in the past 30 months. The MAX grounding allowed Airbus to solidify its leadership in the narrowbody market. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> also stopped development of the New Midmarket Airplane (NMA). <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s termination of the proposed Embraer JV gave Airbus an edge at the smaller end of the narrowbody market with the A220 family. Finally, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> reduced some R&D expenditures in response to financial pressures. On the favorable side, potential new rivals from China and Russia have also seen their new aircraft programs delayed by the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Generally Supportive Defense Environment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch considers the U.S. budget environment to be generally favorable for most defense contractors, despite near-term headwinds. It is possible that broad-based spending cuts take place over the next few years in response to substantial government stimulus spending. However, Fitch expects changes in spending on Procurement and Research, Development, Test, & Evaluation (RDTE) -- the two areas of the budget most relevant to defense contractors -- will be relatively neutral, varying greatly depending on program allocations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The president's FY2022 budget request was up only modestly from the prior year's budget, and on an inflation-adjusted basis it would likely be down. Both houses in Congress have responded with higher spending plans. The President's budget request included funding for most of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s programs, but not the F/A-18 and the P-8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Boeing</b> Capital</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The affirmation of BCC's ratings and revision of the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative reflect the linkage with that of its parent, BA, and the fact that BA has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition to the guarantee, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support the sale of BA's products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, BA's track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further support Fitch's view of BCC as a core subsidiary of BA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consistent with Fitch's 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings and Rating Outlooks of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent. BCC's unsecured debt rating is also equalized to the long-term IDR of the parent, reflecting the unconditional guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated two notches below its most immediate peer, <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (BBB+/F1/Stable). This is largely the result of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s execution challenges in the past several years, which have combined to weaken <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s quantitative rating factors compared with Airbus'. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. In the past, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved better FCF and funds from operations (FFO) due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737 MAX grounding has severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow, and caused debt to rise significantly versus Airbus's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than Airbus's because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense, in addition to services. Airbus currently has a stronger balance sheet and liquidity position. Airbus generally operates with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and this has been widened by the 737 MAX situation at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared to defense sector peer <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> (A-/F1/Stable), <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated three notches lower due to a weaker financial profile that is only partly offset by better business diversification. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated above Embraer (BB+/Negative) because of its superior competitive position and scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--737 MAX - China ungounds the MAX in late 2021, with a few deliveries to the country this year. A delay into the first quarter of 2022 would not affect the ratings or the Outlook. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> completes the delivery of inventoried aircraft from the grounding in late 2022 or early 2023. The 31/month production rate could be pushed back later in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--787 - deliveries resume in late 2021, with inventory worked down through 2022, and possibly into 2023. There will be a spike in deliveries in 2022, as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> meets the unmet demand from late 2020 and 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--777 Programs - 777X enter service in late 2023 or the first half of 2024. Demand for the 777F remains solid;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--747 - The program finishes deliveries in 2022, and shuts down after more than 50 years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Global airline industry continues its recovery, reaching 2019 levels at the end of 2023. Short-haul traffic will recovery sooner, with long-haul later. Capacity will recover ahead of traffic, and the cargo aircraft market remains healthy. Business travel remains depressed for several years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s commercial deliveries grow through 2024, but they do not reach <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s delivery levels prior to the pandemic and the MAX grounding. Fitch expects the number of seats delivered by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> in 2024 will be down 10%-12% compared with 2018 deliveries. There is a mix shift toward narrowbody aircraft and away from widebody aircraft;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 'New Midmarket Airplane' development is not included in Fitch's forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Defense and Space segment (BDS) grows modestly as the result of program wins over the past several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Approximately 4,000 commercial airplanes (more than 100 seats) are retired or remain in long-term storage from 2020-2023, with around 25% of retirements being wide-body aircraft;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade would be limited to Fitch's view of BA's credit profile. Fitch cannot envisage a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade could be driven by a downgrade of BA's ratings or the early termination of the parent guarantee prior to the repayment of BCC's outstanding publicly issued debt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of June 30, 2021 was $63.6 billion (all attributable to BA except $1.5 billion attributable to BCC), of which $6.5 billion was classified as short-term. Most of the debt attributable to BCC consists of intercompany loans from BA to BCC. The company paid $1.15 billion of maturities with cash in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt rose nearly $50 billion during 2019 and 2020, demonstrating the company's access to the capital markets even in downturns. However, the company's debt load is now substantial, and high debt levels will remain a key credit consideration for several years despite Fitch's projections for steady debt reduction starting in late 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The new debt was used to fund the company's cash burn and to build liquidity. Most of the new debt consisted of bonds with a mix of near-term maturities that would allow <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to reduce debt when the twin crises were over, but also some longer-term debt out as far as 2060. The company also issued a term loan to its bank group in early 2020 totaling $13.8 billion. The company issued $9.8 billion of bonds in early 2021, using the proceeds to repay part of the term loan. Fitch expects the remainder of the TL to be paid in late 2021 or prior to maturity in February 2022. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has no commercial paper outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects cash deployment will be almost exclusively focused on debt reduction for the next several years. The company has about $15 billion of maturing debt from 2022 to 2024, and it has some callable debt as well. Fitch estimates there is $20 billion-$21 billion of maturing and callable debt over the next three years, and Fitch estimates <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> should have sufficient FCF and excess liquidity to pay down this debt while still maintaining higher liquidity that it has held in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leverage metrics (both EBITDA and FFO based) will remain high for the 'BBB-' rating (above 3.5x on a gross basis, or 2.0x-2.5x on a net basis) until sometime in 2024. Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will likely have the ability to pay down more debt, but available maturing and callable debt will limit its ability to do this absent a program to tender for additional debt issuances. Other quantitative credit metrics will be more in line with the current rating in 2023, or in a few cases in 2022. Qualitative credit factors are supportive of the current rating or higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With commercial business recovering, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>' liquidity supports the current IG rating. The company ended the second quarter with $36.1 billion of liquidity, consisting of $21.3 billion of cash and investments plus $14.8 billion of unused revolving credit facilities. Approximately $3.1 billion of the REV matures in October 2021, but <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has a term out option of one year. Fitch expects cash flow to turn positive in the next few quarters, leaving <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> with a solid liquidity position. The substantial inventory of new aircraft accumulated in the past two years should be a cash and liquidity tailwind in the next 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Equity remains another source of financial flexibility for the company. Unlike many aviation companies in 2020, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> did not issue public equity to fund liquidity, although it did use stock to fund its 401-K match and to make a discretionary pension contribution. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could issue equity to defend its credit ratings and liquidity position if there are further negative developments in its business, but Fitch has not included stock issuance in its base case forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not expect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to make material pension contributions in the next few years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made $4.0 billion of discretionary pension contributions in 2017, including a $3.5 billion contribution in the form of company shares. The company also made a discretionary contribution of $3.0 billion of BA stock to its pension fund in late 2020. These contributions should satisfy most required contributions for the next several years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s GAAP pension deficit at the end of 2020 was $13.7 billion, but the plan was more than 100% funded on an ERISA basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch initially expected 2021 FCF would be break-even to modestly positive, but we now expect BA will burn $4 billion-$6 billion because of the delays in 787 deliveries and China's MAX recertification. Cash burn in the first half was $4.3 billion, but cash burn in the second quarter was only $0.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aside from the 787 and MAX impacts, Fitch believes 2021 underlying cash flow has been better-than-expected, mainly because of restructuring efforts and new aircraft orders. Fitch estimates fourth-quarter cash flow could be positive if 787 deliveries resume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >There are multiple moving parts to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow in 2021 and through 2022. Headwinds include MAX concessions, inefficiencies at some of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s aircraft facilities due to low production rates, rising inventory of undelivered 787's, higher interest expense, and some working capital investment to support to ramp up of MAX production in 2022. Tailwinds include the delivery of MAX and 787 planes out of inventory, restructuring benefits, and order deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects FCF will be positive in 2022 in the mid-single digits in our base case forecast. Fitch forecasts further improvements in FCF in 2023 and 2024, but not to levels seen prior to 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary, Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, Fitch does not follow this process, but instead looks at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons. BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped making separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were consolidated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BA) is one of the world's largest aerospace & defense firms, founded in Seattle, WA in 1916. The company operates in four principal segments: <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Defense, Space & Security</span> (BDS, 45% of 2020 sales); <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes (BCA, 28% of 2020 sales); <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS, 27% of 2020 sales); and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span> (BCC, less than 1% of 2020 sales). In 2020, 51% of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s revenues came from <span class="companylink">U.S. Government</span> contracts (which include foreign military sales) and international customers accounted for approximately 37% of total revenues.</p>

Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-02 February 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB-' ratings to <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BA; BBB-/F3/Negative) proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes. The callable notes will be issued in multiple parts with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2026. Proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings outstanding under the company's term loan facility, which matures in February 2022. The transactions will not affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s gross debt balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch lowered <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit rating to 'BBB-' from 'BBB' at the end of October 2020. The downgrade reflected a prolonged recovery from the pandemic compared with Fitch's prior expectations, continued pressures from the 737 MAX grounding and Fitch's estimate that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will be challenged to return financial metrics to levels consistent with a mid 'BBB' rating by the end of 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments have been mixed since the downgrade. Favorable developments include the 737 MAX's return to service in some key markets, orders for the 737 MAX and cargo aircraft, the approval and distribution of several COVID-19 vaccines, and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s 737 MAX settlement with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Justice</span>. Negative developments include 787 production delays, deterioration of the 2021 cash flow outlook and the push-back of the date when the 777X will enter service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch continues to expect global airline traffic will not return to 2019 baseline levels until the end of 2023. Fitch's rating case assumes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will deliver its inventory of more than 400 completed 737 MAX aircraft through 2021 and into 2022. While most qualitative rating factors support <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s investment-grade ratings, many of the company's quantitative rating factors will be inconsistent with the 'BBB' category for three years (2019-2021) and into 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Rating Outlook incorporates ongoing uncertainty surrounding the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector, continued pressure on production rates for some commercial aircraft models, the potential for inventory build of aircraft models in addition to the MAX and supply-chain risks. Other pandemic concerns driving the outlook include the continued impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s commercial services business from lower airline traffic and retirement of older aircraft; the ramifications for global GDP, which is a key driver of air traffic trends; and the damage to airline balance sheets. The company's large total debt leaves it exposed to another shock to its business until the dual impact of the pandemic and MAX recedes and debt is reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors supporting the ratings include the strategic positions of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s businesses, diversification, technology, liquidity, access to the debt and equity markets, and a large order backlog. The relative stability of the company's defense and security business plus <b>Boeing</b>'s strong position in cargo aircraft also support the ratings. Substantial cost reductions, including the consolidation of 787 assembly in South Carolina, should help mitigate some pressures on the company's financial position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings also incorporate expectations that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has the potential to strengthen its credit profile via cash generation and debt reduction in the years after 737 MAX deliveries resume and after the coronavirus pandemic recedes. Overall, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a strong credit profile for its rating before the MAX grounding, and Fitch's ratings for the company incorporated the periodic stress periods that arise in the commercial aviation sector. However, the coronavirus is unmatched in its rapid impact on the aviation sector. Total company order backlog at the end of 2020 was $363 billion compared with $463 billion at the end of 2019, with the decline driven by low orders and cancellations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pandemic Impact on Commercial Aircraft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects continued downward pressure on passenger airplane deliveries and production from <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span>, the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Company</span>, and other airplane manufacturers because of a slow recovery to pre-pandemic traffic levels, damaged airline financial profiles, travel restrictions and uncertainty about traveler behavior. Fitch estimates demand for aircraft deliveries will most likely be lower than that suggested by OEM production rates. However, in most scenarios downside production rate risk is lower than the magnitude of the already-announced cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes production will need to decline or airplane manufacturers will need to buildup aircraft inventory for market supply and demand to reach equilibrium. Either path will create cash flow challenges for the manufacturers. The analysis is highly sensitive to assumptions about traffic recovery and aircraft retirements. When growth returns, we assume it will be at a lower rate than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch estimates approximately 4,700 passenger aircraft (those with more than 100 seats) will be produced in 2020 through 2023 based on announced production rates and possible rate increases. This compares with the top end of Fitch's delivery base case range of approximately 4,300 passenger aircraft, with downside risk based on a variety of factors. Fitch believes production is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2025 or 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Commercial Airplane Competitive Position</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> still shares a valuable duopoly with Airbus in large commercial aircraft, but its competitive position has weakened somewhat in the past 18 months. The MAX grounding allowed Airbus to consolidate its leadership in the narrow-body market, particularly the large end of the segment. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> also stopped development of the new midmarket airplane (NMA). <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s termination of the proposed Embraer JV gave Airbus an edge at the smaller end of the narrow-body market with the A220 family. Finally, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> reduced some R&D expenditures in response to financial pressures. On the favorable side for both <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, potential new rivals from China and Russia have seen their new aircraft programs delayed by the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Airline Traffic and Capacity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's base case for airline passenger traffic (domestic and international) assumes revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) will not recover to 2019 levels before FYE23 and at FYE21 will still be 40% below 2019 levels. Underlying this forecast is the assumption that effective vaccines/treatments are available, but not at scale, through 2021, and there will be a continued collapse in travel until there is widespread vaccine/treatment availability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's base case assumes domestic traffic recovers to 2019 levels around the middle of 2023, while international traffic returns to 2019 levels after 2023, perhaps the summer of 2024. Available information so far supports this assumption of domestic recovering first, including the data coming out of the important Chinese domestic market. Fitch expects capacity will recover before RPKs, and the agency believes load factors will remain lower than the record levels seen in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Grounding</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The U.S., the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and several countries have lifted the 737 MAX grounding since late November. Fitch expects the pace of re-certifications to pick up through the first quarter of 2021. China's recertification is a key watch item.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With the groundings lifted, passenger flights have resumed with six airlines, and the number of flights is approaching 3,000. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has delivered more than 40 737 MAX aircraft since the grounding was lifted in the U.S. This will help the company's cash generation, but the program's full cash benefit is not likely to come until 2022. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has also received several new 737 MAX orders, including from <span class="companylink">Ryanair</span> and Alaska Air. The 737 MAX order backlog at the end of December was 3,987 planes, or 3,240 planes adjusted for accounting policies. Fitch estimates the adjusted backlog represents five to six years' worth of production at our delivery forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Logistical issues around the eventual ramp-up of production and deliveries remains a concern. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> faces complicated tasks of delivering more than 400 parked aircraft and ramping up production from currently low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash generation by the MAX in at least the first year after the ungrounding will get a boost from deliveries of already-built aircraft. However, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will also be bearing the expense of continued 737 production at low rates and the impact of concessions to customers. These offsetting factors will cause some uncertainty regarding cash generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below-average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s most immediate peer is <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (BBB+/F1/Negative). Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved better free cash flow (FCF) and funds from operations (FFO) over the past decade, due to program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737 MAX grounding has severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow, and caused debt to rise significantly versus Airbus's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than Airbus's because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense. Airbus currently has a stronger balance sheet and liquidity position. Airbus generally operates with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and this has been widened by the 737 MAX situation at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared to defense sector peer <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated lower due to a weaker financial profile that is only partly offset by better business diversification. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated above Embraer (BB+/Negative) because of its superior competitive position, scale and financial strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX groundings will continue to be lifted in phases by different regions through the remainder of 1Q21 and into 2Q21. Deliveries in various regions will resume shortly after the groundings are lifted;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The inventory of MAX aircraft assembled but undelivered during the grounding will be delivered through 2021 and into 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> delivers approximately 2,100 airplanes through 2023 (around 1,850 commercial, 280 cargo and military derivative), with risks mainly to the downside;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Global airline traffic recovers to 2019 baseline levels at the end of 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Approximately 4,000 commercial airplanes (more than 100 seats) are retired or remain in long-term storage from 2020-2023, with around 25% of retirements wide-body aircraft;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--FCF is break-even or moderately negative for 2021, with the first half of the year showing the heaviest outflows;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt is down modestly in 2021, then for several years <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> uses its free cash flow to pay down debt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Share repurchases and dividends remain suspended through 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--There is additional pressure on the production rates for the 787 and other wide-body models due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but cargo aircraft demand partly offsets weak passenger 777 demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Extended coronavirus pandemic leads to more delivery deferrals, cancellations, and material production cuts of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> airplanes or material declines in revenues at <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS), with 737 MAX program backlog falling to less than 3 years of deliveries;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Coronavirus causes material disruptions to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, including extended shutdowns of key facilities;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material delays in resuming 737 MAX deliveries in a phased manner beyond 1Q21;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage from the 737 MAX;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's other major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Large acquisitions or debt-funded share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material provision of customer financing by BCC;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained consolidated FFO-adjusted leverage above 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins below 1%-2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if Fitch gains confidence the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic will not further materially affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive rating actions could be considered if the company returns the 737 MAX program to a stable condition and begins to reduce debt taken on to fund inventory build related to the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The company issues equity to pay down balance-sheet debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity at the end of 2020 was approximately $35.1 billion, consisting of $25.6 billion of cash and investments plus $9.5 billion of revolving credit facility availability, offset by $1.7 billion of current maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Oct. 26, 2020, the company refinanced its 364-day revolver at $3.1 billion, down $100 million from the prior amount. This facility and its other revolving commitments total $9.5 billion, including a $3.2 billion three-year revolver and a $3.2 billion five-year revolver. The revolving commitments back a CP program of the same size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Access to the public capital markets was favorable in 2020, easing risks about potential government support, secured debt issuance, and revolver draws. In early 2020, the company entered into a two-year delayed draw term loan (DDTL) with a group of banks to cover cash needs during 2020. The amount was $13.8 billion, and the company decided to draw down this unsecured facility early in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In April the company issued $25 billion of long-term unsecured bonds, and in the fourth quarter it issued $4.9 billion of unsecured bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of Dec. 31, 2020, was $63.6 billion ($62.0 billion attributable to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and $1.6 billion attributable to <b>Boeing</b> Capital), of which $1.7 billion was classified as short-term. Most of the debt attributable to <b>Boeing</b> Capital consists of intercompany loans from <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to <b>Boeing</b> Capital; the last significant amount of debt originally issued by BCC and subsequently guaranteed by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> matured in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects significant debt reduction will not begin until 2022, although there are some positive scenarios that could lead to debt reduction in late 2021. Debt reduction will be the focus of FCF deployment for several years. The company could also reduce debt with excess liquidity, so the company's future liquidity policy will be an important item to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> can pay down its term loan at any time, but after that the company's debt maturity schedule will limit rapid debt reduction in the absence of liability management actions such as calling or tendering for bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash generation typically contributes to its liquidity position. The company generated $9.6 billion of FCF in 2018, but FCF was substantially negative in 2019 ($8.9billion) and 2020 ($21 billion) due to the 737 MAX grounding and the pandemic. Fitch expects long-term annual free cash will be at least at 2018 levels, or greater than $9 billion per year. In 2021, FCF will be enhanced by the run-off of MAX inventories, but it will be offset by lower production and customer concessions. Fitch expects modest negative FCF, but the forecast is uncertain on both the downside and upside. Cash flow is likely to be negative in 1H21 before possibly turning positive in 2H21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not expect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to make material pension contributions in the next few years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made $4 billion of discretionary pension contributions in 2017, including a $3.5 billion contribution in the form of company shares. The company made an additional discretionary contribution with $3 billion of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> stock in November of 2020. These contributions should satisfy most required contributions for the next several years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s GAAP pension deficit at the end of 2020 was $13.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, Fitch does not follow this process but instead looks at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis. Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped making separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were de-consolidated.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-29 October 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'. Fitch has also downgraded the Long-Term IDR and senior unsecured ratings of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span> (BCC) to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has also assigned 'BBB-' ratings to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes. The notes will be issued in multiple parts with potential maturities ranging from 2023 to 2030. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which Fitch expects will include paying down commercial paper balances and debt maturities in 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrades reflect a prolonged recovery from the pandemic compared with Fitch's original expectations, continued pressures from the 737 MAX grounding, and Fitch's estimate that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will be challenged to return financial metrics to levels consistent with a 'BBB' by the end of 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch now expects global airline traffic will not return to 2019 baseline levels until the end of 2023. Fitch's rating case assumes the 737 MAX will be re-certified in at least some key markets in November, but the delays in the certification process have lengthened the time frame over which <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will deliver its inventory of more than 450 completed aircraft, a process which will last into 2022. While most qualitative rating factors support <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s investment-grade ratings, many of the company's quantitative rating factors will be inconsistent with the 'BBB' category for three years (2019-2021) and into 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Rating Outlook incorporates ongoing uncertainty surrounding the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector, continued pressure on production rates for some commercial aircraft models, the potential for inventory build of aircraft models in addition to the MAX, and supply-chain risks. Other pandemic concerns driving the outlook include the continued impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s commercial services business from lower airline traffic and retirement of older aircraft; the ramifications for global GDP, which is a key driver of air traffic trends; and the damage to airline balance sheets. The company's large total debt l leaves it exposed to another shock to its business until the dual impact of the pandemic and MAX recedes and debt is reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors supporting the ratings include the strategic positions of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s businesses, diversification, technology, liquidity, access to the capital markets, and a large order backlog. The relative stability of the company's defense and security business plus <b>Boeing</b>'s strong position in cargo aircraft also support the ratings. Substantial cost reductions, including the consolidation of 787 assembly in South Carolina, should help mitigate some pressures on the company's financial position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings also incorporate expectations that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has the potential to strengthen its credit profile via cash generation and debt reduction in the years after 737 MAX deliveries resume and after the coronavirus pandemic recedes. Overall, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a strong credit profile for its rating before the MAX grounding, and Fitch's ratings for the company incorporated the periodic stress periods that arise in the commercial aviation sector. However, the coronavirus is unmatched in its rapid impact on the aviation sector. Total company order backlog at the end of 1Q20 was $393 billion compared with $463 billion at the end of 2019, with the decline driven by low orders and cancellations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Today's proposed debt issuance would enhance liquidity and help fund maturities through 2021. However, it also indicates that the company will not begin reducing debt from 2Q20 levels until 2022. Fitch had previously expected modest debt reduction to begin in late 2020 and in 2021. With today's proposed new issuance, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will have issued more than $42 billion of gross debt in 2020. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will end 2020 with more than $60 billion of gross debt and more than $25 billion of cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pandemic Impact on Commercial Aircraft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects continued downward pressure on passenger airplane deliveries and production from <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span>, the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Company</span>, and other airplane manufacturers because of a slow recovery to pre-pandemic traffic levels, damaged airline financial profiles, travel restrictions and uncertainty about traveler behavior. Fitch estimates demand for aircraft deliveries will most likely be lower than that suggested by OEM production rates. However, in most scenarios downside production rate risk is lower than the magnitude of the already-announced cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes production will need to decline or airplane manufacturers will need to build up aircraft inventory for market supply and demand to reach equilibrium. Either path will create cash flow challenges for the manufacturers. The analysis is highly sensitive to assumptions about traffic recovery and aircraft retirements. When growth returns, we assume it will be at a lower rate than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch estimates more than 4,700 passenger aircraft (those with more than 100 seats) will be produced through 2023 based on announced production rates and possible rate increases. This compares with the top end of Fitch's delivery base case range of approximately 4,300 passenger aircraft, with downside risk based on a variety of factors. We believe production is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2025 or 2026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Commercial Airplane Competitive Position</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> still shares a valuable duopoly with Airbus in large commercial aircraft, but its competitive position has weakened somewhat in the past 18 months. The MAX grounding allowed Airbus to consolidate its leadership in the narrow-body market, particularly the large end of the segment. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> also stopped development of the new midmarket airplane (NMA). <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s termination of the proposed Embraer JV gave Airbus an edge at the smaller end of the narrow-body market with the A220 family. Finally, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> reduced some R&D expenditures in response to financial pressures. On the favorable side for both <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, potential new rivals from China and Russia have seen their new aircraft programs delayed by the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Airline Traffic and Capacity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's base case for airline passenger traffic (domestic and international) assumes revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) will not recover to 2019 levels before FYE23 and at FYE21 will still be 30% below 2019 levels. Underlying this forecast is the assumption that an effective vaccine/treatment is available, but not at scale, through 2021, and there will be a continued collapse in travel until there is widespread vaccine/treatment availability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Our base case assumes domestic traffic recovers to 2019 levels around the middle of 2023, while international traffic returns to 2019 levels after 2023, perhaps the summer of 2024. Available information so far supports this assumption of domestic recovering first, including the data coming out of the important Chinese domestic market. We expect capacity will recover before RPKs, and we believe load factors will remain lower than the record levels seen in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Grounding</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The U.S. and a few other countries are nearing the end of the re-certification process but Fitch does not expect a coordinated global ungrounding as countries are likely to lift the grounding in stages through the fourth quarter and into 2021. Coordination between the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) </span>and the E.U. Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) would be a positive, as they are the two main aircraft certification bodies in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In the US the last key part of the re-certification process was a report on proposed training. This was released for a period of public comment, which ends on November 2. Fitch expects several weeks of review by the FAA, then the grounding could be lifted shortly after. MAX deliveries should resume once the grounding is lifted in one or two key aviation markets, providing <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and aviation suppliers some relief. This will help the company's cash generation, but the program's full cash benefit is not likely to come until 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Additional MAX order cancellations are anticipated, given the coronavirus pandemic's effect on the airline industry but we believe the backlog will remain sufficient to support our current delivery forecasts. There is some downside cushion with respect to MAX deliveries and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s rating. For example, if the contractual backlog were to decline to approximately 3,000 aircraft, Fitch estimates this would still represent more than five or six years' worth of production at our delivery forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Logistical issues around the eventual ramp-up of production and deliveries may also exist. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> faces complicated tasks of delivering more than 450 parked aircraft and ramping up production from currently low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash generation by the MAX in at least the first year after the ungrounding will get a boost from deliveries of already-built aircraft. However, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will also be bearing the expense of continued 737 production at low rates. These two offsetting factors will cause some uncertainty regarding cash generation. Uncertainty will also remain due to potential fines and ongoing investigations related to the crashes and whether <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> accelerates future narrow-body development plans to address Airbus's narrow-body lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" ><b>Boeing</b> Capital</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade of BCC's ratings and the Negative Rating Outlook reflect the linkage with that of its parent, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and the fact that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition to the guarantee, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support the sale of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further support Fitch's view of BCC as a core subsidiary of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. Consistent with Fitch's 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC has historically exhibited sound operating performance, stable asset quality, and a sufficient liquidity profile, although its standalone credit risk profile would likely be lower than 'BBB-' given the cyclicality and residual value risk associated with the aircraft leasing business, the credit risk profile and concentration of BCC's lessors and its elevated leverage relative to standalone aircraft lessors'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's operating income declined in 2020 due to the adverse impact of the coronavirus pandemic on airline customers. Operating performance is expected to remain under pressure in the near-term from the potential for additional asset impairments, reduced finance lease income and an increase in the allowance for losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below-average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s most immediate peer is <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Negative). Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved better free cash flow (FCF) and funds from operations (FFO) over the past decade, due to better program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737 MAX grounding has severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow, and caused debt to rise significantly versus Airbus's. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than Airbus's because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense. Airbus currently has a stronger balance sheet and liquidity position. Airbus generally operates with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and this has been widened by the 737 MAX situation at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is also a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter has significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to address this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared to defense sector peer <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> (A-/Stable), <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated lower due to a weaker financial profile that is only partly offset by better business diversification. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated above Rolls-Royce (BB+/Negative) due mainly to better product diversification and strategic position. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is rated above Embraer (BB+/Negative) because of its superior competitive position, scale, and financial strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX groundings will be lifted in phases by different regions through the remainder of 4Q20 and into 2021. Deliveries in various regions will resume shortly after the groundings are lifted;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The inventory of MAX aircraft assembled but undelivered during the grounding will be delivered through late 2020 and into 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> delivers approximately 2,100 airplanes through 2023 (around 1,850 commercial, 280 cargo and military derivative), with risks mainly to the downside;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Global airline traffic recovers to 2019 baseline levels at the end of 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Approximately 4,000 commercial airplanes (more than 100 seats) are retired or remain in long-term storage from 2020-2023, with around 25% of retirement wide-body aircraft;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- FCF is break-even or modestly positive for 2021, but negative through at least the second quarter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt rises in 2020, then for several years <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> pays down debt and reduces much of its commercial paper (CP) balance;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Share repurchases and dividends remain suspended through 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Additional cuts to the 787 and other wide-body models are possible due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but cargo aircraft demand partly offsets weak passenger 777 demand; and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 777X enters service in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Extended coronavirus pandemic leads to more delivery deferrals, cancellations, and material production cuts of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> airplanes or material declines in revenues at <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS), with 737 MAX program backlog falling to less than 3 years of deliveries;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Coronavirus causes material disruptions to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, including extended shutdowns of key facilities;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material delays in resuming 737 MAX deliveries in a phased manner beyond 1Q21;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage from the 737 MAX;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's other major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Large acquisitions or debt-funded share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material provision of customer financing by BCC;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained consolidated FFO-adjusted leverage above 3.5x; and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins below 1%-2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if Fitch gains confidence the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic will not further materially affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive rating actions could be considered if the company returns the 737 MAX program to a stable condition and begins to reduce debt taken on to fund inventory build related to the 737 MAX program; and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The company issues equity to pay down balance-sheet debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's ratings and Rating Outlook are linked to those of its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade would be limited to Fitch's view of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile. Fitch cannot envisage a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade could be driven by a downgrade of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s ratings or the early termination of the parent guarantee prior to the repayment of BCC's outstanding publicly issued debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity at the end of September 2020 was approximately $36.7 billion, consisting of $27.1 billion of cash and investments plus $9.6 billion of revolving credit facility availability, offset by $3.6 billion of outstanding CP and current maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Oct. 26, 2020, the company refinanced its 364-day revolver at $3.1 billion, down $100 million from the prior amount. This facility and its other revolving commitments total $9.5 billion, including a $3.2 billion three-year revolver and a $3.2 billion five-year revolver. The revolving commitments back the CP program of the same size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Access to the public capital markets has been favorable so far in 2020, easing risks about potential government support, secured debt issuance, and revolver draws. In early 2020, the company entered into a two-year delayed draw term loan (DDTL) with a group of banks to cover cash needs during 2020. The amount was $13.8 billion, and the company decided to draw down this unsecured facility early in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In April the company issued $25 billion of long-term unsecured bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of Dec. 31, 2019, was $27.3 billion ($25.3 billion attributable to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and $2 billion attributable to BCC), of which $7.3 billion was classified as short-term, including $6.1 billion of CP. Consolidated debt, as of September 30, 2020, was $61 billion ($59.1 billion attributable to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and $1.9 billion attributable to BCC). Most of the debt attributable to BCC consists of intercompany loans from <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to BCC; the last significant amount of debt originally issued by BCC and subsequently guaranteed by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> matured in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects significant debt reduction will not begin until 2022, although there are some positive scenarios that could lead to debt reduction in late 2021. Debt reduction will be the focus of FCF deployment for several years. The company could also reduce debt with excess liquidity, so the company's future liquidity policy will be an important item to watch. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> can pay down the DDTL at any time, but after that the company's debt maturity schedule will limit rapid debt reduction in the absence of liability management actions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash generation typically contributes to its liquidity position. The company generated $9.6 billion of FCF in 2018, but 2019 FCF was substantially negative ($8.9 billion) due to working capital build- up related to the 737 MAX. Fitch expects long-term annual free cash will be at least at 2018 levels, or greater than $9 billion per year, but Fitch expects FCF in 2020 will again be significantly negative, approaching ($20 billion), as the company recovers from the MAX grounding. In 2021, FCF will be enhanced by the run-off of MAX inventories; Fitch expects modest positive FCF, but the forecast is uncertain on both the downside and upside. Cash flow is likely to be negative in 1H21 before turning positive in 2H21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not expect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to make material pension contributions in the next few years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made $4 billion of discretionary pension contributions in 2017, including a $3.5 billion contribution in the form of company shares. The company announced an additional $3 billion of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> stock will be issued to the pension fund in November. These contributions should satisfy most required contributions for the next several years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s GAAP pension deficit at the end of 2019 was $15.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, we do not follow this process but instead look at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis. Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons. BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped making separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were consolidated.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

Fitch Ratings: Reductions at <b>Boeing</b> Plant not Expected to Impact Snohomish PUD (WA) Credit Quality</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-02 October 2020: Reports that <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> is expected to move production of the 787 Dreamliner from the Everett Factory in Snohomish County, WA to South Carolina is not expected to affect the credit quality of Snohomish County PUD #1 (WA) rated 'AA-'/Stable, according to <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. This includes the roughly $85 million in series 2020 refunding bonds that priced on Sept. 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's rating, published Sept. 15, considered the then expected reduction of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s electric load of roughly 10% through 2025, due to pandemic related impacts on the aviation industry. Revenue from <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made up just under 4% of the utility's total $686 million operating revenue in fiscal 2019. Fitch's forward look factored in the expectation for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> revenues to decline from $24 million in fiscal 2019 to roughly $22 million going forward, given the delay of the production of the new 777X jet for multiple years, and the expected reduced production of current planes like the 787. Fitch anticipates that moving the production of the 787 jet (the most active production line at the Everett Factory) to South Carolina in the coming years will likely further reduce <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s electric load and negatively impact the local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While Fitch is not able to estimate the timing or size of the decline in revenue and jobs at this time, the agency's analysis notes the district's substantial flexibility in meeting potential load declines while maintaining its very strong financial profile. The district's ability to independently adjust retail electric rates, modify purchased power from its contract with Bonneville, and potentially draw down some portion of its significant cash reserves provide financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The district's very strong financial profile provides some headroom at the current rating. The district's leverage ratio of 5.2x in fiscal 2019, measured by debt and fixed obligations in relation to funds available for debt service, supports the current rating. Incorporated in the rating analysis is a stress case scenario that contemplates a roughly $50 million shock to revenue from the coronavirus pandemic among other potential impacts. Leverage increases to roughly 7.0x in the stress case and remains adequate for the rating. Days cash on hand was 160 days in fiscal 2019.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago/New York-16 September 2020: Aviation regulators and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> have made steady progress on the recertification of the 737 MAX. However, a number of regulatory uncertainties could further delay the return to service (RTS) of the aircraft and the risk of continued order cancellations or deferrals by airlines and lessors due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions also remains, says <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. Downside cushion with respect to MAX deliveries and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>’s rating currently exists but regulatory and backlog uncertainties indicate risks are weighted to the downside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sources of potential recertification delays include timing of the <span class="companylink">US Federal Aviation Administration</span>’s (FAA) public comment evaluation and the Joint Operations Evaluation Board recommendations and Flight Standardization Board (FSB) report public comment period. In addition to other FAA reports and events that are part of the ungrounding process, uncertainty also remains regarding additional requirements by international aviation regulators and whether there will be a separate certification for the 737 MAX 200 variant of the MAX 8. The US Congressional report on the 737 MAX released today is not expected to materially affect the timing of RTS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We do not expect a coordinated global ungrounding but there could be coordination among a few countries. Coordination between the FAA and the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) would be a positive, as they are the two main aircraft certification bodies in the industry. Once the grounding is lifted in one or two key aviation markets, such as the US and EU, MAX deliveries should resume. Additional order cancellations are anticipated, given the pandemic’s effect on the industry, but the backlog should remain sufficient to support our current delivery forecasts.</p>

<b>Boeing</b> Deliveries Fitch Forecasts-CNTs[https://e.infogram.com/ffe31837-60cc-48e0-95d4-a490705862dd?src=embed]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We estimate total 737 MAX program deliveries for the 2019–2023 period will be at least 1,700 aircraft lower than expected at the beginning of 2019. This is a reduction of approximately 50% compared with Fitch’s previous expectations, due to the grounding and the pandemic’s effect on the global airline industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Delivery ranges are driven by the coronavirus’ uncertain evolution, the timing of the FAA’s ungrounding and the timing of the ungrounding in other regions. Visibility into 2021 and 2022 deliveries are further muddied by the lack of the typical signaling from production rates. Additionally, it is not clear at this time how the MAX settlements between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and its customers will affect deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Regulatory and cancellation risks could cause deliveries to be at the bottom of, or even below, these ranges. The timing of the ungrounding will be important, as delays would pressure deliveries before the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2021, causing some airlines to defer additional deliveries. We expect it will take at least 18 months for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to clear its existing 737 MAX inventory of more than 450 aircraft.</p>

Fitch Ratings Previews Seven Key Topics for <b>Boeing</b> and Airbus Second Quarter Earnings</span>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-28 July 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> expects the earnings reports this week from <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BBB/Negative) and <span class="companylink">Airbus S.E</span>. (A-/Negative) to be some of the most important in many years. Here are some top issues and questions Fitch's aerospace analysts have ahead of the earnings releases, filings, and in discussions with management teams as we look into the second half and 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Cash Burn - Liquidity is a credit positive at both companies, but these resources will be eroded the longer the coronavirus pandemic downturn continues. Fitch will be looking for indications of the magnitude of cash used for items such as inventory build, restructuring costs, supplier support, and, for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, 737 Max concessions. Fitch expects substantial cash use, with more than $11 billion likely burned in the first half at both companies. Fitch expects this will continue into the early part of 2021. Fitch forecasts liquidity from various sources will be in the $30 billion-$40 billion range at both companies at quarter-end. A key question is when the two OEMs will be at break-even cash flow levels. Fitch believes this is likely to happen in the second half of 2021, aided by an expected partial recovery in the airline sector and inventory unwind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Commercial Aircraft Deliveries vs. Production Rates - Both OEMs are currently building more planes than they are delivering, which can rapidly drain cash, as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> experienced in the extreme during 2019 with the 737MAX grounding. This is being done partly to support the OEMs' vast supply chains but also to maintain their own core operating capabilities. Fitch expects working capital outflows as production exceeds deliveries for the second half and at least part of 2021 at both OEM's for twin-aisle models and for Airbus with its single-aisle planes. The opposite should be the case for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> single-aisles in 2021 assuming the 737 MAX returns to service, although there will likely be some offsetting WC build as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> readies higher production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Restructuring Progress - We will be looking at how rapidly the companies cut costs in the past quarter and what the expected pace is going forward. We expect restructuring charges in the quarter, with the magnitude a key indicator of how expensive the restructuring will be. Both companies have previewed their restructuring plans, and we will watch for whether they comment on the visibility of the long-term structural shrinkage of the sector and need to announce expanded headcount reductions in their commercial businesses. This is an important topic, as the companies need to balance cost reductions versus preserving the long-term capabilities that are key sources of credit ratings strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Aircraft Finance Market and Potential Customer Financing - Aircraft financing will be a key factor in the eventual recovery in deliveries to airlines. Both <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus have been key financing facilitators, and they have valuable insights into the aircraft debt markets. We will be interested in their views on the capacity of aircraft lessors to provide financing, as airlines will be less able to increase debt in the next few years. Also, what are their views on the export-credit agencies, capital markets, and commercial banks? It would be a downside risk to cash flow forecasts if the OEMs used their own balance sheets to finance customer deliveries. In what cases would the OEMs consider providing customer financing? Fitch's current expectation is that this would only occur for key customers and on a short-term basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Other Business Lines - Non-commercial aircraft businesses provide some diversification for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, but the outlook is mixed. We are watching how defense budgets hold up in the face of higher government budget deficits and debt. Information about new program wins such as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s F-15EX is also important. Do the companies believe demand for cargo aircraft is sustainable? How are their helicopter programs being affected by the downturn in the oil sector? How badly are the commercial services offerings being hurt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Airline Markets by Region - Fitch believes that differences will begin to emerge among airline industry regions as the pandemic progresses. Are the OEMs seeing different levels of demand by region in this global industry? Could some regions emerge from the pandemic sooner, providing some support to aircraft deliveries? This is already becoming evident in parts of Asia, as capacity is ramping up again, but does this translate into willingness to take deliveries?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737Max - The coronavirus pandemic has overtaken the MAX as the key credit issue at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, but the airplane is still a key concern. Aviation regulators will decide when the plane can carry passengers, but the pandemic will determine the pace of deliveries, which is the key to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> unlocking the 11-digit MAX inventory on its balance sheet. We don't expect many detailed comments about the FAA certification process, but we will be interested in any logistical updates for return-to-service, concessions paid in the quarter and whether estimated total concessions will be affected by recent order cancelations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-30 April 2020: LEAD PARAGRAPH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned 'BBB' ratings to <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BA; BBB/Negative/F2) proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes. The notes will be issued in multiple parts with maturities ranging from 2022 to 2060. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which Fitch expects will include paying down commercial paper balances and debt maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On March 24, Fitch downgraded BA's long-term ratings and the long-term ratings for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span> (BCC) to 'BBB' from 'A-' and removed the ratings from Rating Watch Negative. The actions reflected the rapid escalation of the coronavirus pandemic and the effect it is having on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s aviation markets and operations. The Rating Outlook is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's rating case includes expectations for a significant global economic downturn with a gradual recovery into 2021 and 2022. This scenario will dramatically affect airline traffic and financial results, driving requests for delivery deferrals and lower maintenance expenditures. Fitch does not expect global aviation markets to return to 2019 levels until 2022, and in some cases 2023. Under this scenario, BA's financial metrics will be very weak for the current rating in 2020, but the company has sufficient liquidity, including today's bond issuance, to withstand the downturn. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will be able to rebuild its credit metrics, already weakened by the 737 MAX grounding, to levels consistent with a 'BBB' category rating by the end of 2021 or early 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Rating Outlook is driven by the risk of a more extended coronavirus pandemic, the ongoing risks related to the timing of the return-to-commercial service (RTCS) of the 737 MAX, and the pace of the 737 MAX delivery ramp up after the grounding is lifted. In the case of a second wave of infections or a prolonged coronavirus impact, including extended shut-downs of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s key facilities or material delays on the 737 MAX RTCS, Fitch's expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could need access to additional capital, which could further pressure BA's credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors related to coronavirus, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, will remain key concerns for BA's ratings. These factors include the continued impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s commercial services business from lower airline traffic; the potential for increased requests for commercial airplane delivery deferrals; the ramifications for global GDP, which is a key driver of air traffic trends; and the direct impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, particularly in the Seattle area. Another key concern is whether the coronavirus prolongs the 737 MAX grounding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings are supported by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s competitive positions in its main businesses. In addition, the ratings incorporate expectations that BA has the potential to strengthen its credit profile via cash generation and debt reduction in the years after 737 MAX deliveries resume and after the coronavirus pandemic recedes. Overall, BA had a strong credit profile for its rating before the MAX grounding, and Fitch's ratings for the company incorporated the periodic stress periods that arise in the commercial aviation sector. However, the coronavirus is unmatched in its rapid impact on the aviation sector. Fitch's forecasts include conservatism for potentially higher cost related to the 737 MAX situation. Fitch believes the lack of material 737 MAX cancelations since the grounding illustrates the aviation industry's continued support for the aircraft, which also supports the rating. Total company order backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was $439 billion compared to $463 billion at the end of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt nearly doubled in 2019 to around $27.0 billion, and debt rose to $38.9 billion at the end of the first quarter after <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> drew down its $13.8 billion delayed draw term loan. Debt will continue to rise in with today's debt issuance. Fitch expects year-end 2020 debt could be approximately $45 billion after the company reduces commercial paper balances and meets debt maturities. If ending debt is higher than $45 billion, Fitch expects it would be offset by higher cash balances. Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will prioritize debt pay down starting in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus risks for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> are both global and local. From a global perspective, Fitch has several virus related concerns related to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial performance. First, lower air traffic will hurt results at <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS) due to lower aftermarket services and parts; Fitch estimates BGS could see revenues down mid-teens in 2020. The pandemic has also spurred airline delivery deferral requests, and aircraft deliveries will be lower than previously expected in both 2020 and 2021. This was a key driver of Fitch's forecast revisions and the rating downgrade in March. Fitch believes wide-body demand has taken the biggest hit, but the situation will also lead to a slower 737 MAX production ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Locally, coronavirus will affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, particularly in the Seattle area, which the virus has hit harder than many other regions in the U.S. Approximately 45% of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>' employees are in Washington State. The company's facilities in the region were closed for about one month, but recently reopened. A negative scenario, in Fitch's view, would be if <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s key facilities nation-wide had to be shut again for several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Commercial Aircraft Deliveries:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects aircraft deliveries will be lower than previously expected in both 2020 and 2021, which was a key driver of the rating downgrade in March. The new production rates that <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> announced on Wednesday are in line with Fitch's forecasts from the March rating downgrade. Wide-body demand has taken the biggest hit, but the situation will also lead to a slower MAX production ramp up. Fitch believes there are risks of additional production cuts, which is incorporated in the Negative Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's forecasts are informed by the firm's credit view of the global airline industry, as well as insights from Fitch's aircraft leasing and aircraft ABS teams. Fitch's global airline ratings incorporate scenarios where revenues fall 75% to 100% in the second quarter of 2020 before beginning a slow recovery in the second half. Delivery deferrals are key elements of most airlines' near-term plans to address the severe liquidity pressures caused by the pandemic. Fitch believes some of the deferrals will be into the second half of 2020, but some will flow into 2021. After the recovery begins, airlines will have higher debt levels and lower liquidity than pre-pandemic, which will drive additional delivery deferrals in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The wide-body aircraft market will be most affected given the severe impact on long-haul routes. Deliveries in 2021 will fall at least one-third, and could be down 50% from recent peak production levels. Cargo aircraft could see less pressure than passenger jets, at least initially. Overbooking will relieve some of the delivery pressure on the 737 MAX, but Fitch expects the production ramp up will slow versus prior expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Other risks to the delivery outlook include supply chain disruptions and the aircraft finance market. Fitch has included no material customer financing from <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> in its forecasts, but it would be negative for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile if the company needs to meet some of its financing commitments due to disruption in the capital markets. Fitch expects the <span class="companylink">U.S. Export-Import Bank</span> will ease some of the pressure in the market and could see a significant amount of activity in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Grounding:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A key rating concern continues to be regulatory risk and uncertainty regarding the timing and global sequencing of the 737 MAX' RTCS. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> continues to expect expects the ungrounding will begin in mid-2020. Fitch believes the pandemic increases the risk that this date could be pushed back. The MAX will likely be a concern throughout the aviation credit sector through 2021 as the airline industry catches up on delayed MAX deliveries. The MAX situation reduced much of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial cushion in the 'A' category, leaving the company more exposed to other unforeseen events or industry developments, such as the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The logistical challenge of returning the planes to service and catching up on deliveries is also a concern, particularly considering the risk of supplier challenges with an extended 737 MAX production suspension. BA's substantial debt build-up over the past 12 months is another concern. There is also uncertainty over the ultimate amount of concessions BA will make to airlines, although there is a chance that negotiations regarding virus-related deferrals could lead to lower concessions. The MAX situation is also likely to increase business risk from fines, litigation, weakened competitive position, or reputation damage. Fitch expects there will be a lingering operating margin impact for several years even after the MAX returns to commercial service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views the MAX situation as partly an issue of timing unless substantial orders are cancelled. However, key uncertainties remain in addition to the unclear timing on RTCS. These include pilot training requirements, public perception of the MAX, MAX valuations, aircraft finance impact and lawsuits/investigations. There is also uncertainty surrounding the phasing of RTCS throughout the world. It is also clear that the role of regulators in the airplane certification process will change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Embraer Joint Venture Termination</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On April 25, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> terminated the agreement to establish several joint ventures with Embraer (ERJ/BB+/Negative). Fitch believes this illustrates how the coronavirus has changed the aerospace sector's priorities. The termination will benefit BA's liquidity, as it will not spend $4.2 billion to help establish the proposed JV. It also will not consolidate $3.5 billion of related debt. The termination also frees up management time and resources to address the key challenges at hand, namely the coronavirus and the MAX. Some strategic questions arise, such as whether the termination opens the door for other aspiring aerospace players to link up with ERJ. Fitch expects litigation is likely. Termination does not preclude future tie ups between the two companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential Capital Needs and Potential Government Support:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA's decision to suspend its dividend was a form of self-help that will reduce cash outflows by approximately $9 billion over the next two years. However, in the scenario of a prolonged coronavirus impact or a second wave of infections, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could need access to additional capital to bridge liquidity until the economy recovers or MAX deliveries resume. Additional debt beyond current expectations could pressure the 'BBB' ratings unless the debt is used to build liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has general concerns regarding continued comments about the possibility of government support, but broad government support for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> is not incorporated into Fitch's analysis. Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and its suppliers would require government support in the scenario of an extended pandemic combined with significant disruption of the public capital markets. However, various Federal Reserve programs lessen some concerns. Support for airlines worldwide by various governments indirectly supports the aerospace sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG: BA has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s most immediate peer is <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Positive). Several key credit factors differentiate the two companies' ratings. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved better FCF and FFO over the past decade, due to better program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737 MAX grounding has severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow, and caused debt to rise significantly versus Airbus. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than Airbus' because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense. Airbus currently has a stronger balance sheet and liquidity position. Airbus generally operates with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and this has been widened by the 737 MAX situation at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter have significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to lessen the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX groundings will be lifted in phases by different regions through 3Q20. Deliveries in various regions will resume in 2020 shortly after the groundings are lifted;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total MAX inventory build will exceed $15 billion;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX program order backlog does not suffer material cancelations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BA moves the 737 production rate up at a slower than previously expected rate due to the impact of the coronavirus on the airline industry;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The inventory of MAX aircraft assembled but undelivered during the grounding will be delivered in 2020 and 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Margins are negatively affected by MAX-related costs in 2019 through 2021, but remain consistent with the rating in 2021, with EBIT margin approximately 10%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Concessions and other considerations for 737 MAX customers affected by the grounding will rise from the $8.8 billion amount already estimated and recognized by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt rises in 2020, then for several years <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> pays down debt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Share repurchases remain suspended through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The dividend suspension remains in effect through 2021 and part of 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 777X enters service in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could lead, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Extended coronavirus pandemic leads to more delivery deferrals of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> airplanes or material declines in revenues at BGS;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The coronavirus causes material disruptions to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, including extended shut-downs of key facilities;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Substantial order cancellations and related material cost increases for the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material delays in resuming 737 MAX deliveries in a phased manner beyond the mid-year 2020 time frame;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage from the 737 MAX situation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's other major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Large acquisitions, particularly combined with a sector downturn, or debt-funded share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained consolidated FFO-adjusted leverage above 3.0x to 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins below 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if Fitch gains confidence the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic will not materially affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive rating actions could be considered if the company returns the 737 MAX program to a stable condition and begins to reduce debt taken on to fund inventory build related to the 737 MAX program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s liquidity at the end of March 2020 was approximately $20 billion, consisting of $15.5 billion of cash and investments plus $9.6 billion of revolving credit facility availability, offset by $5.2 billion of short-term debt. Liquidity will initially be enhanced by today's debt issuance. The termination of the Embraer joint venture will help the liquidity outlook during 2020, as <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will no longer make the $4.2 billion payment to fund the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Oct. 30, 2019, the company refinanced and increased its revolving commitments to $9.6 billion, including a $3.2 billion 364-day revolver, a $3.2 billion three-year revolver, and a $3.2 billion five-year revolver. The revolving commitments back the CP program of the same size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In early 2020, the company entered into a two-year Delayed Draw Term Loan with a group of banks to cover cash needs during 2020. The amount was $13.8 billion. The company decided to draw down the facility early in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of Dec. 31, 2019, was $27.3 billion ($25.3 billion attributable to BA, and $2.0 billion attributable to BCC), of which $7.3 billion was classified as short-term, including $6.1 billion of CP. Consolidated debt, as of March 31, 2020, was $38.9 billion ($36.9 billion attributable to BA, and $2 billion attributable to BCC), of which $5.2 billion was classified as short-term. Most of the debt attributable to BCC consists of intercompany loans from BA to BCC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash generation typically contributes to its liquidity position. The company generated $9.6 billion of FCF in 2018, but 2019 FCF was substantially negative ($8.9 billion) due to working capital build up related to the 737MAX. Fitch expects long term annual FCF will be at least at 2018 levels, or greater than $9 billion per year, but Fitch expects FCF in 2020 will again be significantly negative as the company recovers from the MAX grounding. In 2021, FCF will be enhanced by the run-off of MAX inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not expect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to make material pension contributions in the next few years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made $4.0 billion of discretionary pension contributions in 2017, including a $3.5 billion contribution in the form of company shares. This satisfied most required contributions for the next several years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s GAAP pension deficit at the end of 2019 was $15.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, Fitch does not follow this process, but instead look at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis. Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons. BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped making separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were consolidated.</p>

Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-29 April 2020: A <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> rebaixou os IDRs (Issuer Default Ratings - Ratings de Inadimplência do Emissor) de Longo Prazo em Moedas Estrangeira e Local da <span class="companylink">Embraer S.A</span>. (Embraer) para 'BB+' (BB mais), de 'BBB-' (BBB menos), e afirmou o Rating Nacional de Longo Prazo da empresa em 'AAA(bra)', atribuindo Perspectiva Estável à classificação. A Observação Negativa foi removida e a agência atribuiu Perspectiva Negativa aos IDRs. O rating das notas sem garantias reais da Embraer foi removido da Observação Positiva e rebaixado para 'BB+' (BB mais), de 'BBB-' (BBB menos). O rating das notas estava em Observação Positiva, aguardando a criação de uma joint venture comercial com a <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, IDRs 'BBB'/Perspectiva Negativa).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As ações de rating refletem os fortes obstáculos enfrentados pelo setor de aviação comercial, devido à pandemia do coronavírus, que vem resultando em alto volume de adiamentos nas entregas de aeronaves, menores investimentos em manutenção e forte concorrência no mercado de jatos comerciais e executivos. A Fitch acredita que este cenário levará à deterioração da geração de fluxo de caixa livre (FCF) e dos indicadores de crédito da Embraer no período de 2020 a 2022. O cancelamento do acordo com a <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> impõe desafios adicionais à posição competitiva da Embraer de médio a longo prazos, embora abra a possibilidade de acordos com outras empresas de aviação. A Embraer reportou, em 2019, USD121 milhões em custos de cisão relacionados à joint venture proposta. O cenário-base da Fitch não inclui qualquer reembolso, diante da discussão em andamento entre as partes e da incerteza sobre o momento desta potencial entrada de caixa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A Perspectiva Negativa dos IDRs reflete as elevadas incertezas em torno do setor de aviação e o risco de continuidade das medidas de distanciamento social entre a segunda metade de 2020 e o início de 2021. A capacidade da Embraer de ajustar rapidamente suas operações e sua estrutura de custos será essencial para minimizar a elevada queima de caixa, projetada pela Fitch em cerca de USD1 bilhão. A ausência de grandes amortizações de dívida durante 2020 e 2021 e a forte posição de liquidez, aliadas ao acesso aos mercados de crédito no Brasil e no exterior, são pontos fortes para o rating da Embraer. O cenário-base da agência estima que a alavancagem líquida da empresa ficará em cerca de 11,0 vezes e 4,0 vezes em 2020 e 2021, respectivamente.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Os ratings da Embraer refletem suas posições competitivas nos mercados de jatos comerciais e executivos, seu robusto backlog (carteira de pedidos firmes), de USD16,8 bilhões, que abrange vários anos de vendas, e programas no segmento de defesa do Brasil. O forte perfil de liquidez da companhia (principalmente fora do país) e suas elevadas receitas de exportação, combinadas com o fluxo de caixa operacional no exterior, sustentam ainda mais os ratings 'BB+' (BB mais), que estão acima do Teto-país do Brasil, 'BB'. As preocupações com o crédito incluem novos programas de desenvolvimento de aeronaves em andamento, incluindo a transição para a aeronave E2, o impacto nos pedidos e nos backlogs a longo prazo, a concorrência acirrada nos mercados de jatos comerciais e executivos, novos participantes no mercado de jatos comerciais e as baixas margens operacionais da companhia em vários segmentos de negócios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PRINCIPAIS FUNDAMENTOS DO RATING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pressão Elevada: No cenário atual, com o aumento do número de adiamentos de entregas de aeronaves, a Fitch acredita que haverá redução de 50% no volume de entregas de aeronaves comerciais em 2020 e alguma recuperação em 2021. Em termos de entregas de jatos executivos, a queda deve ser menor, em torno de 15% a 20%, tendo em vista a diferente dinâmica de negócios. A agência estima que a Embraer enfrentará desafios adicionais para impulsionar os pedidos da nova aeronave E2. O backlog da companhia totalizava 338 aeronaves no final do quarto trimestre de 2019, frente a 435 aviões há dois anos. Na visão da Fitch, a carteira de pedidos sustentará a produção da Embraer nos próximos anos, apesar de ser impactada por fatores como concentração e qualidade. A agência observa que a aeronave E175-E2 é, atualmente, muito pesada para atender às cláusulas de escopo existentes no mercado dos Estados Unidos. Estas cláusulas devem ser renegociadas para que a aeronave seja viável, ou os pedidos precisarão ser convertidos para E1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Baixo Risco Relacionado ao Brasil: Aproximadamente 90% da receita da Embraer são gerados por exportações ou operações comerciais no exterior. No entanto, o ambiente econômico e político do Brasil representa preocupação, uma vez que a maior parte da base de ativos operacionais da companhia está domiciliada no país. O Brasil está listado como parte relacionada nos registros da Embraer à <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> (SEC, Comissão de Títulos e Câmbio dos EUA), devido à ‘golden share’ que o governo brasileiro detém na empresa, além de sua participação como acionista direto (aproximadamente 5% da Embraer), por meio de uma empresa controlada pelo governo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Atualmente, a Fitch não considera o Teto-país do Brasil um fator de limitação dos ratings da Embraer, tendo em vista a robusta posição de caixa da empresa fora do Brasil, bem como seu forte foco nas exportações e no crescimento dos negócios no exterior. Com base nestes fatores, de acordo com a metodologia da agência, a Embraer poderia ser classificada até três graus acima do Teto-país brasileiro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Margem de EBIT Pressionada: O desempenho operacional da Embraer foi mais fraco do que o esperado no ano passado e deve apresentar tendência ligeiramente negativa em 2020. A empresa vem enfrentando pressões em suas margens operacionais, enquanto desenvolve vários novos programas. A redução do volume de entregas na aviação comercial e o mix menos favorável afetaram a diluição do custo fixo da Embraer em 2019. Em um cenário de adiamento significativo nas entregas de aeronaves, as margens operacionais serão ainda mais pressionadas. Em 2020, a Fitch estima que a margem de EBIT da companhia ficará negativa, em torno de 1%, e apresentará recuperação em 2021 e 2022, aumentando para 4,6% e 5,8%, respectivamente.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >FCF Negativo: A fraca geração de fluxo de caixa operacional e os investimentos em curso devem levar a Embraer a queimar cerca de USD1 bilhão em caixa em 2020, segundo estimativas da Fitch. De acordo com o cenário-base da agência, o fluxo de caixa das operações (CFFO) da companhia deverá ficar negativo em mais de USD500 milhões em 2020, pressionado pela redução nas entregas de aeronaves e pelas necessidades de capital de giro. Os investimentos operacionais estão estimados em cerca de USD400 milhões. Em 2021, a expectativa é de que o FCF atinja o ponto de equilíbrio, em torno de USD71 milhões, após investimentos de USD450 milhões.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Alta Alavancagem: A Fitch estima que a alavancagem líquida da Embraer (dívida líquida/EBITDA) aumentará para 11,0 vezes em 2020 e se reduzirá para 4,2 vezes em 2021 e para 3,8 vezes em 2022, em comparação com 2,0 vezes em 2018 e com a média de 1,0 vez no período de 2015 a 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >SENSIBILIDADE DOS RATINGS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fatores que podem, individual ou coletivamente, levar a uma ação de rating positiva/elevação:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- A Perspectiva dos IDRs da Embraer pode ser revisada para Estável se o desempenho da companhia em 2020 e em meados de 2021 levar a índices de alavancagem líquida em torno de 3,5 vezes em 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- A elevação dos IDRs para grau de investimento dependerá do retorno de índices de alavancagem líquida abaixo de 2,5 vezes, em bases sustentáveis, além da manutenção de forte posição de liquidez, sem grandes riscos de refinanciamento a médio prazo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fatores que podem, individual ou coletivamente, levar a uma ação de rating negativa/rebaixamento:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Cancelamentos substanciais de pedidos nos programas E1 e E2 e no segmento de jatos executivos;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Atrasos significativos e aumentos de custos nos programas E2, KC-390 ou outros;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Impossibilidade de reduzir custos e de reportar geração de FCF acima do esperado;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Manutenção de alavancagem líquida consistentemente acima de 3,5 vezes até o fim de 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Quedas substanciais na liquidez, sem reduções proporcionais de dívida;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Rebaixamento, em vários graus, no rating soberano do Brasil, juntamente com um rebaixamento semelhante no Teto-país.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Melhores e Piores Cenários de Rating</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Os ratings de crédito em escala internacional de Empresas Não Financeiras têm o melhor cenário de elevação (definido como o 99º percentil de transições de ratings, medido em uma direção positiva) de três graus ao longo de um horizonte de rating de três anos; e o pior cenário de rebaixamento (definido como o 99º percentil de transições de ratings, medido em uma direção negativa) de quatro graus ao longo de três anos. A faixa completa de melhores e piores cenários de ratings de crédito para todas as categorias de rating varia de 'AAA' a 'D'. Os melhores e piores cenários de ratings de crédito se baseiam no histórico de desempenho. Informações adicionais sobre a metodologia utilizada para determinar os melhores e piores cenários de rating específicos do setor estão disponíveis em https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >PRINCIPAIS PREMISSAS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Manutenção dos principais programas de desenvolvimento, E190-E2 e KC-390, dentro do cronograma e do orçamento;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Redução das entregas de aeronaves comerciais da Embraer para cerca de 50% em 2020 e 20% em 2021 (em comparação com 2019) e estabilização ou aumento deste percentual em 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Redução de entregas no mercado de jatos executivos de 20% em 2020 e de 15% em 2021 (em comparação com 2019), seguindo uma tendência mais resiliente para este segmento;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Expectativa de margem de EBIT negativa em 2020 (cerca de 1,3%), com ligeira recuperação em 2021 e 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- FCF negativo em USD1 bilhão em 2020;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Investimentos em torno de USD400 milhões em 2020 e 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Expectativa de captação de cerca de USD1 bilhão em novas dívidas de longo prazo para financiar a geração de FCF negativo em 2020, a custos financeiros atrativos;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Manutenção de forte liquidez ao longo do período projetado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RESUMO DA ANÁLISE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A Embraer é uma das líderes do mercado de jatos comerciais com menos de 150 assentos. Suas aeronaves são conhecidas pela engenharia, pela semelhança entre os modelos e pelo design interno. A carteira da empresa apresentava 338 pedidos firmes em 31 de dezembro de 2019, incluindo jatos da nova família E2. A carteira total de pedidos, que abrange contratos de todos os segmentos, totalizava USD16,8 bilhões no mesmo período. A posição competitiva da Embraer — mais fraca que a de seus principais pares globais, sobretudo a <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> e a Airbus —, baseada em escala e força financeira, é parcialmente compensada por sua boa posição no segmento de jatos comerciais com menos de 150 assentos, bem como por seu perfil financeiro administrável.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A alavancagem, as margens e a liquidez da Embraer são melhores que as da <span class="companylink">Bombardier Inc</span>. (IDRs 'CCC'), mas esta última apresenta maior diversificação de negócios. A <span class="companylink">Bombardier Inc</span>. também opera nos segmentos de jatos executivos e defesa. A maioria das operações da Embraer está no Brasil, embora a companhia esteja deslocando grande parte de sua linha de montagem de jatos executivos para os EUA. A metodologia da Fitch de atribuição de ratings acima do Teto-país foi aplicada a esta análise.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As principais fontes de informação utilizadas na análise estão descritas nas Metodologias Aplicadas listadas abaixo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >LIQUIDEZ E ESTRUTURA DA DÍVIDA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Forte Liquidez: No entender da Fitch, a flexibilidade financeira da Embraer é relativamente conservadora, considerando sua posição de liquidez, que é fundamental para sustentar os ratings. A empresa tem uma política de manter forte liquidez, o que a Fitch considera adequado, tendo em vista as despesas com programas periódicos de desenvolvimento e a natureza do setor aéreo comercial. A agência acredita que a Embraer permanecerá disciplinada no que diz respeito à liquidez e manterá sua abordagem proativa na gestão de passivos, para evitar a exposição a riscos de refinanciamento. A companhia não possui linhas de crédito rotativo, o que não é incomum para emissores corporativos latino-americanos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Em 31 de dezembro de 2019, a Embraer tinha dívida de USD3,4 bilhões, incluindo uma posição líquida de USD271 milhões em dívidas no âmbito de uma Sociedade de Propósito Específico (SPE) e USD282 milhões em garantias de financiamentos de venda (depósitos em garantia). O caixa total e os investimentos no final do período eram de USD2,7 bilhões -- montante suficiente para cobrir a amortização da dívida até, pelo menos, 2023. A maior parte da dívida da Embraer vence após este período. Em 31 de dezembro de 2019, aproximadamente 86% do caixa, equivalentes e investimentos financeiros da empresa estavam denominados em dólares.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-28 April 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded <span class="companylink">Embraer S.A</span>.'s Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB+' from 'BBB-', and has affirmed Embraer's National Scale Rating at 'AAA(bra)'. The Rating Watch Negative has been removed. The Rating Outlook for the IDRs is Negative. Embraer's unsecured bonds have been removed from Rating Watch Positive and downgraded to 'BB+' from 'BBB-'. The bonds had been on Positive Watch pending the establishment of a commercial joint venture with <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BBB/Negative).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating actions reflect the strong headwinds for the commercial aviation industry due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has resulted in a high level of aircraft deferrals, lower maintenance expenditures, and strong competition in commercial and business jet market. Fitch believes this environment will lead to deterioration in Embraer's FCF generation and credit metrics during 2020-2022. The cancelation of a deal with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> poses additional challenges to Embraer's medium to long-term competitive position, although it does open the possibility of arrangements with other aviation companies. Embraer reported USD121 million of separation costs related to the proposed JV during 2019. Fitch's base case scenario does not include any reimbursement, given the ongoing discussion between the parties and uncertainty regarding the timing of this potential cash inflow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Rating Outlook is driven by the high uncertainties surrounding the aviation industry and the risk of a continuation of distancing measures into the latter half of 2020 and early 2021. Embraer's ability to quickly adjust its operations and cost structure will be key to minimizing the high cash burn, which Fitch projects to be around USD1 billion. Embraer's lack of major debt amortization during 2020 and 2021 and strong liquidity position and access to credit markets in Brazil and abroad, are key credit strengths. Fitch's base case scenario foresees Embraer's net leverage moving to around 11.0x and 4.0x, during 2020 and 2021, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Embraer's ratings reflect its competitive positions in the commercial and business jet markets, robust backlog (USD16.8 billion) covering several years of sales, and Brazilian defense programs. Embraer's solid liquidity profile (mostly held outside Brazil) and its large export revenues combined with some offshore operating cash flow further support its 'BB+' ratings, which is above Brazil's 'BB' country ceiling. Rating concerns include ongoing new aircraft development programs, including the transition to the E2 aircraft, and the impact on orders and backlogs in the long term, significant competition in both the commercial and business jet markets, new entrants into the commercial jet market, and low operating margins in several business segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Elevated Pressure: Amid the current scenario, with increasing level of aircraft deferrals, Fitch expects a 50% decline in commercial aircraft deliveries for 2020 and some recovery during 2021. For business jet deliveries, the decline should be lower, around 15%-20%, given different business dynamics. Fitch expects that Embraer will face additional challenges to boost the orders of its new E2 aircraft. The firm order backlog stood at 338 aircraft at the end of 4Q19, down from 435 planes two years ago. In Fitch's view, the backlog supports production for the next several years, but suffers from concentration and quality. Fitch notes that the E175-E2 is currently too heavy to meet existing scope clauses in the U.S. market; the scope clauses must be renegotiated for this aircraft to be viable or orders will need to be converted to the E1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Modest Brazilian Risk: Approximately 90% of Embraer's revenue is generated from exports or from business operations based abroad. Nonetheless, Brazil's economic and political environment is a concern as the majority of Embraer's operating asset base is locally domiciled. Brazil is listed as a related party in Embraer's SEC filings as a result of the Brazilian government's "golden share" and a direct shareholder stake (approximately 5% of Embraer) via a company controlled by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not consider Brazil's country ceiling a rating constraint for Embraer currently, given the company's large cash holding outside of Brazil, as well as its heavy focus on exports and growing business outside of Brazil. Based on these factors, under Fitch's criteria, Embraer could be rated up to three notches higher than the Brazilian country ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >EBIT Margin Pressured: Embraer's operating performance has been weaker than expected during the past year and should trend slightly negative during 2020. Embraer was facing pressures on its operating margins as it navigates several new development programs. The lower deliveries in commercial aviation and less favorable mix have affected the company's fixed cost dilution during 2019. In a scenario of meaningful aircraft deferrals, operating margins will be further pressured. During 2020, Fitch estimates Embraer's EBIT margin to be negative, around 1%, and will show recovery during 2021 and 2022, increasing to 4.6% and 5.8%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Negative FCF: The poor operating cash flow generation and the ongoing capex should lead Embraer to burn around USD1 billion in cash during 2020, per Fitch's estimates. Under Fitch's base case scenario, Embraer's cash flow from operations (CFFO) for 2020 is expected to be negative by more than USD500 million, pressured by a decline in deliveries and working capital needs. Capex is estimated around USD400 million. For 2021, FCF is expected to be breakeven level, around USD71 million, after capex of USD450 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Leverage: Fitch forecasts Embraer's net leverage (net Debt/EBITDA) to increase to 11.0x in 2020, to decline to 4.2x in 2021 and to 3.8x during 2022. This compares to 2.0x in 2018 and an average of 1.0x during the 2015-2017 period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Embraer is one the market leaders for commercial jets with fewer than 150 seats. Its aircraft are known for their engineering, commonality across models and interior design. The company had 338 firm jet orders in backlog at the end of Dec. 31, 2019, including jets in the new E2 family. Embraer's total backlog, including contracts from all segments, was USD16.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2019. Embraer's weaker competitive position compared with major global peers, notably <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, based on scale and financial strength, is partially offset by its good business position in the niche of commercial jets with fewer than 150 seats, and its manageable financial profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Embraer compares favorably versus its competitor <span class="companylink">Bombardier Inc</span>. (CCC) in leverage, margins and liquidity; however, Bombardier has more business diversification. The company also operates in the executive jet and defense segments. Embraer's bulk of operations are in Brazil, but the company is shifting much of its executive jet assembly to the U.S. Fitch's rating above country-ceiling methodology is being applied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Embraer's key development programs, the E190-E2 and KC-390, remain on time and budget;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Embraer's commercial deliveries decline to approximately 50% in 2020 and 20% (versus 2019) in 2021 but stabilize or begin to rise in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The business jet market deliveries decline 20% in 2020 and 15% (versus 2019) in 2021, following a more resilient trend for this segment;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBIT margin to be in the negative territory during 2020 (around 1.3%) and then slightly recover during 2021 and 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Embraer to generate negative USD1 billion in FCF in 2020;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Investment expenditures are around USD400 million in 2020 and 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The company is able to raise around USD1 billion in new long-term debt to fund negative free cash flow generation during 2020 at attractive financial costs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Embraer maintains strong liquidity throughout the forecast period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--A revision of the Outlook to Stable could occur if Embraer's performance during 2020 and mid-2021 leads to net leverage of around 3.5x during 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An upgrade to investment grade level would is dependent on a return to net leverage below 2.5x on sustainable basis, in addition to maintenance of a strong liquidity position with no major refinancing risks in the medium term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Substantial order cancellations in the E1 and E2 programs and business jet segment;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Significant delays and cost increases on the E2, KC-390 or other programs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Failure to sufficiently reduce costs and post larger than expected FCF generation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Net leverage remaining consistently above 3.5x by end of 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Substantial declines in liquidity without commensurate debt reductions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Multiple notch downgrade of Brazil's sovereign rating, along with a similar reduction in the country ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Liquidity: Fitch views Embraer's financial flexibility as relatively conservative given its liquidity position, which is a key factor supporting the ratings. Embraer has a policy of maintaining healthy liquidity, which Fitch considers appropriate given the cost of periodic development programs and the nature of the commercial aerospace industry. Fitch expects that the company will remain disciplined with its liquidity position and will maintain its proactive approach in liability management to avoid exposure to refinancing risks. Embraer does not have a revolving credit facility, which is not uncommon for Latin American corporate issuers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Embraer had USD3.4 billion of debt as of Dec 31, 2019, which includes net position of USD271 million of debt at the SPE's level and USD282 million of sales financing guarantees (guarantee deposits). Total cash and investments at the end of the period were USD2.7 billion, which is sufficient to support debt amortization up to at least 2023. The bulk of Embraer's debt matures beyond 2023. At Dec. 31, 2019, approximately 86% of the company's cash, equivalents and financial investments were in U.S. dollars.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-24 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the long-term ratings for the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BA) and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span> (BCC) to 'BBB' from 'A-' and removed the ratings from Rating Watch Negative. The actions reflect the rapid escalation of the coronavirus pandemic and the effect it is having on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s aviation markets and operations. Fitch has also affirmed BA's short-term ratings at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's rating case includes expectations for a significant global economic downturn through the second quarter of 2020, followed by a recovery in the second half of the year and into 2021. This scenario will dramatically affect airline traffic and financial results, driving requests for delivery deferrals and lower maintenance expenditures. Under this scenario, Fitch does not expect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will rebuild its credit metrics, already weakened by the 737 MAX grounding, to levels consistent with an 'A' category rating by the end of 2021, resulting in the downgrade to 'BBB'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Rating Outlook is driven by the risk of a more extended coronavirus pandemic, the ongoing risks related to the timing of the return-to-commercial service (RTCS) of the 737 MAX, and the pace of the 737 MAX delivery ramp up after the grounding is lifted. In the case of a prolonged coronavirus impact, including extended shut-downs of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s key facilities, or material delays on the 737 MAX RTCS, Fitch's expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could need access to additional capital to bridge liquidity needs until the economy recovers, which could further pressure BA's credit profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors related to coronavirus, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, will remain key concerns for BA's ratings. These factors include the continued impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s commercial services business from lower airline traffic; the potential for increased requests for commercial airplane delivery deferrals, particularly for wide-body models; the ramifications for global GDP, which is a key driver of air traffic trends; and the direct impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, particularly in the Seattle area. Another key concern remains whether the 737 MAX grounding is lifted by mid-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings are supported by the competitive positions of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s businesses. In addition, the ratings incorporate expectations that BA has the potential to strengthen its credit profile via cash generation and debt reduction in the years after 737 MAX deliveries resume and after the coronavirus pandemic recedes. Overall, BA had a strong credit profile for its rating before the MAX grounding, and Fitch's ratings for the company incorporated the periodic stress periods that arise in the commercial aviation sector. However, the coronavirus is unprecedented in its rapid impact on the aviation sector. Fitch's forecasts include conservatism for potentially higher cost related to the 737 MAX situation. Fitch believes the lack of material 737 MAX cancelations since the grounding illustrates the aviation industry's continued support for the aircraft, which also supports the rating. Total company order backlog at the end of 2019 was $463 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition to the pandemic and the 737 MAX, the company has a challenging agenda, including the <span class="companylink">Embraer S.A</span>. (ERJ, BBB-/Rating Watch Negative) transaction, 777X development, and other new product development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt nearly doubled in 2019 to around $27.0 billion as a result of $10.5 billion of long-term debt issuance and several billion dollars of CP issuance. Debt will continue to rise in 2020, potentially peaking at around $45 billion. Starting in 2021, Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will pay down debt and reduce much of its CP balance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus Pandemic:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The coronavirus pandemic has added another significant challenge to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s already crowded agenda. To date the global airline industry has seen air traffic severely affected. This was first noted in China and the broader Asia-Pacific region, the aviation sector's fastest growing area, although there are some indications that a recovery in Chinese aviation has begun. All of other regions have now seen the coronavirus impact. Globally, the virus' impact on aviation could worsen depending on the pandemic's duration and severity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus risks for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> are both global and local. From a global perspective, Fitch has several virus related concerns related to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial performance. First, lower air traffic will hurt results at <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS) due to lower aftermarket services and parts; Fitch estimates some parts of BGS could see revenues down mid-teens in 2020. The segment's results would be further affected if the pandemic serves as a catalyst for an extended global recession. The pandemic has also spurred airline delivery deferral requests, and aircraft deliveries will be lower than previously expected in both 2020 and 2021. This is a key driver of Fitch's forecast revisions and the rating downgrade. Fitch believes wide-body demand has taken the biggest hit, but the situation could also lead to a slower 737 MAX production ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Locally, coronavirus will affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, particularly in the Seattle area, which the virus has hit harder than most other regions in the U.S. Approximately 45% of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>' employees are in Washington State, where the governor has directed residents to stay at home. The company announced a temporary shut-down of Seattle area operations for two weeks. Several employees at its Everett facility, where most of the company's twin-aisle aircraft are assembled, have contracted coronavirus. A negative scenario, in Fitch's view, would be if operations at the Everett facility or other key facilities nation-wide had to be slowed or shut for several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Commercial Aircraft Deliveries:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects aircraft deliveries will be lower than previously expected in both 2020 and 2021, which is a key driver of the rating downgrade. Fitch believes wide-body demand has taken the biggest hit, but the situation could also lead to a slower MAX production ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's forecasts are informed by the firm's credit review of the global airline industry last week, as well as insights from Fitch's aircraft leasing and aircraft ABS teams. The global airline review incorporated scenarios where capacity or revenues fall 75% to 100% for many airlines in the second quarter of 2020 before recovering in the second half. The review resulted in negative rating actions across the board, mostly Negative Outlooks. Delivery deferrals are key elements of most airlines' near-term plans to address the severe liquidity pressures caused by the pandemic. Fitch believes some of the deferrals will be into the second half of 2020, but some will flow into 2021. After the recovery begins, airlines in general will have higher debt levels and lower liquidity than pre-pandemic, which will drive additional delivery deferrals in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The wide-body aircraft market will be most affected, in Fitch's view, given the severe impact on long-haul routes. Deliveries in 2021 could fall one-third or more. Cargo aircraft could see less pressure than passenger jets. Overbooking will relieve some of the delivery pressure on the 737 MAX, but Fitch expects the production ramp up will slow versus prior expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Other risks to the delivery outlook include supply chain disruptions and the aircraft finance market. Fitch has included no material customer financing from <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> in its forecasts, but it would be negative for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile if the company does need to meet some of its financing commitments due to disruption in the capital markets. Fitch expects the <span class="companylink">U.S. Export-Import Bank</span> will ease some of the pressure in the market and could see a significant amount of activity in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Grounding:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A key rating concern continues to be regulatory risk and uncertainty regarding the timing and global sequencing of the 737 MAX' RTCS. On Jan. 21, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> issued a statement that it now expects the ungrounding will begin in mid-2020. It is unclear how the coronavirus affects the MAX timeline, but Fitch believes the pandemic increases the risk that this date could be pushed back. The MAX will likely be a concern throughout the aviation credit sector through 2021 as the airline industry catches up on delayed MAX deliveries. The MAX situation reduced much of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial cushion in the 'A' category, leaving the company more exposed to other unforeseen events or industry developments, such as the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The logistical challenge of returning the planes to service and catching up on deliveries is also a concern, particularly considering the risk of supplier challenges with an extended 737 MAX production suspension. BA's substantial debt build-up over the past 12 months is another concern. There is also uncertainty over the ultimate amount of concessions BA will make to airlines. The MAX situation is also likely to increase business risk from fines, litigation, weakened competitive position, or reputation damage. Fitch also expects there will be a lingering operating margin impact for several years even after the MAX returns to commercial service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views the MAX situation as partly an issue of timing unless substantial orders are cancelled. However, key uncertainties remain in addition to the unclear timing on RTCS. These include pilot training requirements, public perception of the MAX, negotiations with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers over concessions, MAX valuations, aircraft finance impact, and lawsuits/investigations. There is also uncertainty surrounding the phasing of RTCS throughout the world. It is also clear that the role of regulators in the airplane certification process will change. Upcoming watch items include the FAA certification test flight and first quarter earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Potential Capital Needs and Potential Government Support:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA's decision to suspend its dividend was a form of self-help that will reduce cash outflows by approximately $9 billion over the next two years. However, in the scenario of a prolonged coronavirus impact, including extended shut-downs of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s key facilities, or material delays on the 737 MAX RTCS, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could still need access to additional capital to bridge liquidity until the economy recovers or MAX deliveries resume. Additional debt beyond current expectations could pressure the 'BBB' ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has general concerns regarding continued comments about the possibility of government support, but broad government support for the aerospace sector is not incorporated into Fitch's analysis. Debate about various proposals continues in Washington. Fitch believes <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and its suppliers would require government support in the scenario of an extended pandemic combined with significant disruption of the public capital markets. However, the announcement of the new Federal Reserve programs yesterday lessened some concerns. Support for airlines worldwide by various governments would indirectly support the aerospace sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade and Negative Outlook revision of BCC's ratings and reflect the linkage with that of its parent, BA, and the fact that BA has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support for the sale of BA's products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, BA's track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further support Fitch's view of BCC as a core subsidiary of BA. Consistent with Fitch's 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC has historically exhibited sound operating performance, stable asset quality, and a sufficient liquidity profile, although its standalone credit risk profile would likely be lower than 'BBB' given the cyclicality and residual value risk associated with the aircraft leasing business, the credit risk profile and concentration of BCC's lessors and its elevated leverage levels relative to standalone aircraft lessors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's operating income declined in 2019 due to lower gains on the sale of assets and the recognition of modest impairments, driven by one customer. Asset quality as deteriorated slightly in recent years as the decline in the total receivable portfolio has outpaced the reduction in assets placed on non-accrual status. However, Fitch believes that current loss reserves provide adequate support relative to potential losses on receivables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG: BA has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s most immediate peer is <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Positive). Several key credit factors differentiate the two companies' ratings. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> consistently achieved better FCF and FFO over the past decade, due to better program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. However, the 737 MAX grounding has severely affected <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow, and caused debt to rise significantly versus Airbus. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile has also been modestly stronger than Airbus' because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense. Airbus currently has a stronger balance sheet and liquidity position. Airbus generally operates with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, and this has been widened by the 737 MAX situation at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is a key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter have significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to lessen the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX groundings will be lifted in phases by different regions through 3Q20. Deliveries in various regions will resume in 2020 shortly after the groundings are lifted;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total MAX inventory build will exceed $15 billion;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX program order backlog does not suffer material cancelations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BA moves the 737 production rate up at a slower than expected rate due to the impact of the coronavirus on the airline industry;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The inventory of MAX aircraft assembled but undelivered during the grounding will be delivered in 2020 and 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Margins are negatively affected by MAX-related costs in 2019 through 2021, but remain consistent with the rating in 2021, with EBIT margin approximately 10%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Concessions and other considerations for 737 MAX customers affected by the grounding will rise from the $8.8 billion amount already estimated and recognized by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>-Embraer commercial JV closes in the second half of 2020. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> finances its $4.2 billion payment to Embraer with cash and also consolidates approximately $3.5 billion of Embraer debt and a similar amount of cash;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt rises in 2020, then for several years <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> pays down debt and reduces much of its CP balance;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Share repurchases remain suspended through the forecast period;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The dividend suspension remains in effect through 2021 and part of 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Additional cuts to the 787 and other wide-body models due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic; The 787 production rate is already scheduled to be reduced to 12 per month from 14 per month in late 2020 and then to 10 per month in early 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 777X enters service in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Extended coronavirus pandemic leads to more delivery deferrals of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> airplanes or material declines in revenues at BGS;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Coronavirus causes material disruptions to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, including extended shut-downs of key facilities;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Substantial order cancellations and related material cost increases for the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material delays in resuming 737 MAX deliveries in a phased manner beyond the mid-year 2020 time frame;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage from the 737 MAX situation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's other major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Large acquisitions, particularly combined with a sector downturn, or debt-funded share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained consolidated FFO-adjusted leverage above 3.0x to 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins below 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if Fitch gains confidence the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic will not materially affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive rating actions could be considered if the company returns the 737 MAX program to a stable condition and begins to reduce debt taken on to fund inventory build related to the 737 MAX program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's ratings and Rating Outlook Negative are linked to those of its parent. The revision of BCC's Rating Outlook will be limited to Fitch's view of BA's credit profile. Fitch cannot envisage a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent. Negative rating actions could be driven by a downgrade of BA's ratings or the early termination of the parent guarantee prior to the repayment of BCC's outstanding publicly issued debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a consolidated liquidity position of approximately $13.5 billion as of YE 2019, consisting of $10.0 billion in cash and investments and $9.6 billion of revolving credit facility availability, offset by $6.1 billion of outstanding CP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Oct. 30, 2019, the company refinanced and increased its revolving commitments to $9.6 billion, including a $3.2 billion 364-day revolver, a $3.2 billion three-year revolver, and a $3.2 billion five-year revolver. The new $9.6 billion of revolving commitments back the CP program of the same size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In early 2020, the company entered into a two-year Delayed Draw Term Loan with a group of banks to cover cash needs during 2020. The amount was $13.8 billion. The company decided to draw down the facility early in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of Dec. 31, 2019, was $27.3 billion ($25.3 billion attributable to BA, and $2.0 billion attributable to BCC), of which $7.3 billion was classified as short-term, including $6.1 billion of CP. Most of the debt attributable to BCC consists of intercompany loans from BA to BCC; the last significant amount of debt originally issued by BCC and subsequently guaranteed by BA matured in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash generation typically contributes to its liquidity position. The company generated $9.6 billion of FCF in 2018, but 2019 FCF was substantially negative ($8.9 billion) due to working capital build up related to the 737MAX. Fitch expects long term annual free cash will be at least at 2018 levels, or greater than $9 billion per year, but Fitch expects FCF in 2020 will again be significantly negative as the company recovers from the MAX grounding. In 2021, FCF will be enhanced by the run-off of MAX inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch does not expect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> to make material pension contributions in the next few years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made $4.0 billion of discretionary pension contributions in 2017, including a $3.5 billion contribution in the form of company shares. This satisfied most required contributions for the next several years. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s GAAP pension deficit at the end of 2019 was $15.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, we do not follow this process but instead look at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis. Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons. BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped making separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were consolidated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Ratings with Credit Linkage to other ratings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's ratings and Rating Watch are linked to those of its parent, <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA has an ESG relevance score of '4' for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-13 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has placed the ratings for the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Company</span> (BA) and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span> (BCC) on Rating Watch Negative, reflecting the impact coronavirus is having on the aviation sector. This new risk combines with the ongoing risks related to the timing of the return-to-commercial service (RTCS) of the 737 MAX. These concurrent risks could influence the pace of the 737 MAX delivery ramp up after the grounding is lifted, which could slow the rate of debt reduction from peak debt levels, which will be higher than Fitch previously expected. Fitch currently rates BA's Long-Term ratings 'A-', Short-Term ratings 'F2' and BCC's Long-Term ratings 'A-'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors related to coronavirus, including the length and severity of the pandemic, will be key considerations in Fitch's resolution of the Rating Watch. These factors include the potential for reductions in commercial airplane delivery rates, particularly for wide-body models; the impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s commercial services business from lower airline traffic; the ramifications for global GDP, which is a key driver of air traffic; and the direct impact on <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, particularly in the Seattle area, which is the main location of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s commercial airplane segment. In addition, influencing the resolution of the Rating Watch will be whether the 737 MAX grounding is lifted by mid-year. Finally, Fitch will evaluate how these factors affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s ability to improve credit metrics to levels consistent with 'A' category ratings by the end of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings are supported by the performance of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s other businesses besides the 737 MAX, which provide significant support at the current rating level, although coronavirus could put some of this performance at risk. In addition, the ratings incorporate expectations that BA has the potential to strengthen its credit profile via cash generation and debt reduction in the year after 737 MAX deliveries resume. Overall, BA had a strong credit profile for its 'A' category rating before the MAX grounding, and Fitch's ratings for the company incorporated the periodic stress periods that arise in the commercial aviation sector. Fitch's forecasts include significant conservatism for potentially higher cost related to the 737 MAX issue. Access to the capital markets and financial flexibility also support the rating. Fitch believes the lack of material 737 MAX cancelations since the grounding illustrates the aviation industry's continued support for the aircraft, which also supports the rating. Total company order backlog at the end of 2019 was $463 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition to the 737 MAX, the company has a challenging agenda, including the <span class="companylink">Embraer S.A</span>. (ERJ, BBB-/Rating Watch Negative) transaction, 777X development, and other new product development. coronavirus adds another challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt nearly doubled in 2019 to $27.3 billion as a result of $10.5 billion of long-term debt issuance and several billion dollars of CP issuance. Debt will continue to rise in 2020, potentially peaking at more than $40 billion, which is higher than Fitch's previous estimate. In late 2020 and throughout 2021, Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will pay down debt and reduce much of its CP balance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The coronavirus pandemic adds another significant challenge to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s already crowded agenda. To date, the global airline industry has seen air traffic negatively affected, in some regions severely. This is notably the case in China and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the aviation sector's fastest growing area, although there are some indications that a recovery in Chinese aviation has begun. Globally, the virus's impact on aviation could worsen depending on the pandemic's duration and if travel bans are extended or broadened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Coronavirus risks for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> are both global and local. From a global perspective, Fitch has several virus-related concerns. First, lower global air traffic will likely hurt results at <b>Boeing</b> Global Services (BGS) due to lower aftermarket services and parts. The magnitude of the impact on BGS will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic. The segment's results would also be affected if the pandemic serves as a catalyst for a global recession. The pandemic could also spur lower airline capital expenditures, which might lead to delivery deferral requests or order cancelations. Fitch's concern here is mainly that wide-body delivery rates at the <b>Boeing</b> Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment could come down, and this situation could lead to a slower MAX production ramp up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Locally, coronavirus could affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, particularly in the Seattle area, which the virus has hit harder than most other regions in the U.S. Some sources indicate that Washington state accounts for approximately 30% of reported coronavirus cases in the U.S., with approximately 75% of related U.S. deaths coming from the region. Approximately 45% of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s employees are located in Washington state. There are reportedly several infected employees at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s Everett facility, where most of the company's twin-aisle aircraft are assembled. A serious negative scenario, in Fitch's view, would be if operations at the Everett facility were slowed or temporarily shut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Grounding</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >A key rating concern continues to be regulatory risk and uncertainty regarding the timing and global sequencing of the 737 MAX' RTCS. On January 21, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> issued a statement that it now expects the ungrounding will begin in mid-2020. The MAX will likely be a concern throughout the aviation credit sector through 2021 as the airline industry catches up on delayed MAX deliveries. The MAX issue has reduced much of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial cushion in the 'A' category, leaving the company more exposed to other unforeseen events or industry developments, such as coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The logistical challenge of returning the planes to service and catching up on deliveries is also a concern, particularly considering the risk of supplier challenges with an extended 737 MAX production suspension. BA's substantial debt build-up over the past twelve months is another concern. There is also uncertainty over the ultimate amount of concessions BA will make to airlines. The MAX situation is also likely to increase business risk from fines, litigation, weakened competitive position, or reputation damage. Fitch also expects there will be a lingering operating margin impact for several years even after the MAX returns to commercial service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views the MAX situation as partly an issue of timing unless substantial orders are cancelled. However, key uncertainties remain in addition to the unclear timing on RTCS. These include pilot training requirements, public perception of the MAX, negotiations with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers over concessions, MAX valuations, aircraft finance impact, and lawsuits/investigations. There is also uncertainty surrounding the phasing of RTCS throughout the world. It is also clear that the role of regulators in the airplane certification process will change. Upcoming watch items include the FAA certification test flight and first quarter earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The placement of BCC's ratings on Negative Rating Watch reflects the linkage with that of its parent, BA, and the fact that BA has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support for the sale of BA's products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, BA's track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further support Fitch's view of BCC as a core subsidiary of BA. Consistent with Fitch's "Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria", the ratings of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC has historically exhibited sound operating performance, stable asset quality, and a sufficient liquidity profile, although its standalone credit risk profile would likely be lower than 'A-' given the cyclicality and residual value risk associated with the aircraft leasing business, the credit risk profile and concentration of BCC's lessors and its elevated leverage levels relative to standalone aircraft lessors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's operating income declined in 2019 due to lower gains on the sale of assets and the recognition of modest impairments, driven by one customer. Asset quality has deteriorated slightly in recent years as the decline in the total receivable portfolio has outpaced the reduction in assets placed on non-accrual status. However, Fitch believes that current loss reserves provide adequate support relative to potential losses on receivables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s most immediate peer is <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Positive). Despite convergence in credit profiles over the past several years, several key credit factors still differentiate the two companies' ratings. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has consistently achieved better FCF and FFO over the past decade, due to better program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. Cash generation should continue to grow at both companies; however, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow advantage is likely to persist once it gets past the 737 MAX grounding. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile is also modestly stronger than Airbus' because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense. Both companies have strong balance sheets and liquidity positions, with Airbus generally operating with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is another key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter have significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to lessen the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Its Rating Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX groundings will be lifted in phases by different regions through early 3Q20. Deliveries in various regions will resume in 2020 shortly after the groundings are lifted;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total MAX inventory build will exceed $15 billion;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX program order backlog does not suffer material cancelations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BA gradually moves the 737 production rate towards the 52/month range through 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The inventory of MAX aircraft assembled but undelivered during the grounding will be delivered in 2020 and into 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Margins are negatively affected by MAX-related costs in 2019 through 2021, but remain consistent with the rating in 2021, with EBIT margin approximately 11%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Concessions and other considerations for 737 MAX customers affected by the grounding will rise from the $8.8 billion amount already estimated and recognized by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>-Embraer commercial JV closes in May or later in 2020. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> finances its $4.2 billion payment to Embraer with cash and also consolidates approximately $3.0 billion of Embraer debt and a similar amount of cash;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt rises further in 2020, then for several years <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> pays down debt and reduces much of its CP balance;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Share repurchases remain suspended through 2020 and 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--After a pause in 2020, dividends continue to rise, but at a slower rate than in the past five years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 787 production rate is reduced to 12 per month from 14 per month in late 2020 and then moves to 10 per month in early 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 777X enters service in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Extension or broadening of coronavirus travel bans leads to production cuts of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> airplanes or material declines in revenues at BGS;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Coronavirus causes material disruptions to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s operations, including Seattle operations such as the Everett facility;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Substantial order cancellations and related material cost increases for the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material delays in resuming 737 MAX deliveries in a phased manner beyond the mid-year 2020 time frame;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage from the 737 MAX situation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's other major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Large acquisitions, particularly combined with a sector downturn, or debt-funded share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained consolidated FFO-adjusted leverage above 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained free cash flow margins below 3-4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The ratings could be removed from Rating Watch and affirmed if Fitch gains confidence the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic will not materially affect <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s credit profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive rating actions are not likely to be considered until the company returns the 737 MAX program to a stable condition and reduces debt taken on to fund inventory build related to the 737 MAX program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's ratings and Negative Rating Watch are linked to those of its parent. The resolution of the Rating watch will be limited to Fitch's view of BA's credit profile. Fitch cannot envisage a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent. Negative rating actions could be driven by a downgrade of BA's ratings or the early termination of the parent guarantee prior to the repayment of BCC's outstanding publicly issued debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a consolidated liquidity position of approximately $13.5 billion as of year-end 2019, consisting of $10 billion in cash and investments and $9.6 billion of revolving credit facility availability, offset by $6.1 billion of outstanding commercial paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Oct. 30, 2019, the company refinanced and increased its revolving commitments to $9.6 billion, including a $3.2 billion 364-day revolver, a $3.2 billion three-year revolver, and a $3.2 billion five-year revolver. The new $9.6 billion of revolving commitments back the CP program of the same size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In early 2020 the company entered into a two-year Delayed Draw Term Loan with a group of banks to cover cash needs during 2020. The amount was $13.8 billion. The company decided to draw down the facility early in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of Dec. 31, 2019, was $27.3 billion ($25.3 billion attributable to BA, and $2.0 billion attributable to BCC), of which $7.3 billion was classified as short term, including $6.1 billion of CP. Most of the debt attributable to BCC consists of intercompany loans from BA to BCC; the last significant amount of debt originally issued by BCC and subsequently guaranteed by BA matured in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s strong cash generation typically contributes to its liquidity position. The company generated $9.6 billion of FCF in 2018, but 2019 FCF was substantially negative ($8.9 billion) due to working capital build up related to the 737MAX. FCF was ($5.1 billion) after dividends in the first nine months of 2019; Fitch estimates the MAX had at least a $10.0 billion negative impact, leaving the rest of BA's operations generating approximately $5 billion of FCF. Fitch expects long term annual free cash will be at least at 2018 levels, or greater than $9 billion per year. Fitch expects FCF in 2020 will again be negative as the company recovers from the MAX grounding, but in 2021 FCF will be enhanced by the run-off of MAX inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, Fitch does not follow this process but instead looks at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis. Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons. BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013 <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped producing separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were not consolidated.</p>

</div><div>4284 words</div><div>22 January 2020</div><div>Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary</div><div>FITRA</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-22 January 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BA) long-term ratings at 'A-' and short-term ratings at 'F2'. <b>Boeing</b> Capital's (BCC) long-term ratings have also been affirmed at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Outlook revision is based on continued regulatory risk and uncertainty regarding the timing and global sequencing of the 737MAX' return-to-commercial service (RTCS). On Jan. 21, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> issued a statement that it now expects the ungrounding will begin in mid-2020. This is later than Fitch's base case assumption, but it does not trip our downgrade guidelines. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s statement appears to be driven partly by conservatism. Nonetheless, the unexpected statement adds to Fitch's concerns for the possibility of additional delays that push the ungrounding beyond mid-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The logistical challenge of returning the planes to service and catching up on deliveries also drives the outlook, particularly considering the risk of rising supplier challenges with an extended 737 MAX production suspension. BA's substantial debt build-up over the past nine months is another concern. There is also uncertainty over the ultimate amount of concessions BA will make to airlines, with additional training requirements potentially adding to previous expectations. The MAX situation, including recently-released internal emails, is also likely to increase business risk from fines, litigation, weakened competitive position, or reputation damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating affirmation reflects the performance of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s other businesses, which provide significant support at the current rating level. In addition, affirmation incorporates expectations that BA has the potential to strengthen its credit profile via cash generation and debt reduction in the three to four quarters after 737 MAX deliveries resume. Overall, BA had a strong credit profile for its 'A' rating before the MAX grounding, and Fitch's ratings for the company incorporated the periodic stress periods that arise in the commercial aviation sector. Fitch's forecasts include significant conservatism for potentially higher cost related to the 737 MAX situation. Access to the capital markets and financial flexibility also support the rating. Fitch believes the lack of material 737 MAX cancelations since the grounding illustrates the aviation industry's continued support for the aircraft, which also supports the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The MAX will likely be a concern throughout the aviation credit sector into 2021 as the airline industry catches up on delayed MAX deliveries. The MAX situation has reduced much of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial cushion in the 'A' category, leaving the company more exposed to other unforeseen events or industry developments. In addition to the MAX, the company has a challenging agenda, including the <span class="companylink">Embraer S.A</span>. (ERJ, BBB-/Rating Watch Negative) transaction, 777X development, potential New Mid-Market Airplane (NMA) launch, and several planned production rate increases. Fitch also expects there will be a lingering operating margin impact for several years even after the MAX returns to commercial service. Other concerns include various lawsuits and investigations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt nearly doubled in 2019 to around $27.0 billion as a result of $10.5 billion of long-term debt issuance and several billion dollars of CP issuance. Debt will continue to rise in the first and second quarters of 2020, potentially peaking at more than $32 billion-$34 billion, before beginning to decline. In late 2020 and 2021, Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will pay down debt and reduce much of its CP balance. Share repurchases remain a significant source of financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity needs will likely peak in 1Q20 or early 2Q20 as a result of continued MAX-related cash usage, the payment related to the close of the ERJ joint venture (JV) transaction, and a debt maturity. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could issue additional debt, which is incorporated into Fitch's forecasts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Grounding:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch views the MAX situation as partly an issue of timing unless substantial orders are cancelled. However, key uncertainties remain in addition to the unclear timing on RTCS. These include pilot training requirements, public perception of the MAX, negotiations with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers over concessions, MAX valuations, aircraft finance impact, and lawsuits/investigations. There is also uncertainty surrounding the phasing of RTCS throughout the world. It is also clear that the role of regulators in the airplane certification process will change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes the aviation community is approaching the 737 MAX situation in a balanced manner. Fitch believes that the aviation sector sees this as temporary, is looking at the narratives in the final Lion Air accident report and preliminary accident reports, and notes the MAX's operating history prior to the grounding, which lasted more than a year and a half, with more than 200K flights and 30-40 million passengers by Fitch's estimates. The Lion Air final report was somewhat consistent with the preliminary report, and there were no real surprises. It confirmed that there were other contributing factors to the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The temporary suspension of 737 production should reduce cash burn related to the 737 MAX grounding by as much as half the estimated $1.5 billion monthly inventory build Fitch estimated prior to the suspension. BA will still spend money on employees and program fixed costs. Fitch also expects BA will use some cash to support some suppliers. In some respects, the suspension will be a negative for other related parties such as suppliers and airline customers. It should also increase program costs of the MAX, reducing long-term program margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Upcoming watch items include the Ethiopian final report, FAA certification test flight, and fourth quarter earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating affirmation for BCC primarily reflects that BA has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition to the guarantee, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support the sale of BA's products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, BA's track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further support Fitch's view of BCC as a core subsidiary of BA. Consistent with Fitch's 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC has historically exhibited sound operating performance, stable asset quality, and a sufficient liquidity profile, although its standalone credit risk profile would likely be lower than 'A-' given the cyclicality and residual value risk associated with the aircraft leasing business, the credit risk profile and concentration of BCC's lessors and its elevated leverage levels relative to standalone aircraft lessors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's revenues and operating income have remained relatively flat, driven by portfolio run-off and aircraft sales, offset by modest new origination activity. Asset quality has also remained relatively stable over the years, as the company has worked through a number of credit issues within its portfolio and reduced overall risk resulting from a decrease in customer financing. Fitch believes that current loss reserves, the current supportive aircraft financing environment, and improved airline credit fundamentals, provide adequate support relative to potential losses on receivables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s most immediate peer is <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Positive). Despite convergence in credit profiles over the past several years, several key credit factors still differentiate the two companies' ratings. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has consistently achieved better FCF and FFO over the past decade, due to better program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. Cash generation should continue to grow at both companies, but <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow advantage is likely to persist once it gets past the 737 MAX grounding. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile is also modestly stronger than Airbus' because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense. Both companies have strong balance sheets and liquidity positions, with Airbus generally operating with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is another key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter have significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to lessen the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX groundings will be lifted in phases by different regions through early 3Q20. Deliveries in various regions will resume in 2020 shortly after the groundings are lifted;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Total MAX inventory build will exceed $15 billion. While the 737 MAX is grounded and the production line is open, BA builds working capital at a rate of as much as $1.5 billion per month as a result of the 737 MAX deliveries shut-down. The production suspension reduces this by up to a half;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 737 MAX program order backlog does not suffer material cancelations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BA gradually moves the 737 production rate back towards the 42/month - 52/month range starting in the second or third quarter of 2020, and raises the rate to 57/month in 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The inventory of MAX aircraft assembled but undelivered during the grounding will be delivered in 2020 and into 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Margins are negatively affected by MAX-related costs in 2019 through 2021, but remain consistent with the rating in 2020 and 2021, with EBIT margin approximately 11%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Concessions and other considerations for 737 MAX customers affected by the grounding will rise from the $6.1 billion amount already estimated and recognized by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>-Embraer commercial JV closes in April or May of 2020. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> finances its $4.2 billion payment to Embraer with cash and also consolidates approximately $3.0 billion of Embraer debt and a similar amount of cash;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Debt nearly doubles in 2019 to around $27.0 billion as a result of $10.5 billion of long-term debt issuance and several billion dollars of CP issuance. Debt will likely rise further in the first and second quarters of 2020. In 2020 and 2021, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> pays down debt and reduces much of its CP balance;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Share repurchases remain suspended through 2020, then could resume in 2021, but at lower levels than in recent years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--After a pause in 2020, dividends continue to rise, but at a slower rate than in the past five years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 787 production rate is reduced to 12 per month from 14 per month and is maintained at this rate for 2021 and 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--The 777X enters service in 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BA launches the NMA in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive rating actions are not likely to be considered until the company returns the 737 MAX program to a stable condition and reduces debt taken on to fund inventory build related to the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An improvement in the company's credit profile from higher commercial aircraft deliveries, debt reduction and pension contributions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Several initiatives to boost margins, if successful;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modifying the cash deployment strategy to have less focus on share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Substantial order cancellations and related material cost increases for the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material delays in resuming 737 MAX deliveries in a phased manner beyond the mid-year 2020 time frame;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage from the 737 MAX situation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's other major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Large acquisitions, particularly combined with a sector downturn, or debt-funded share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained consolidated FFO-adjusted leverage above 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained FCF margins below 3%-4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--BCC's ratings and Rating Outlook are linked to those of its parent. Positive rating actions would be limited to Fitch's view of BA's credit profile. Fitch cannot envisage a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent. Conversely, negative rating actions could be driven by a change in BA's ratings or the early termination of the parent guarantee prior to the repayment of BCC's outstanding publicly issued debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a consolidated liquidity position of approximately $17.4 billion as of Sept. 30, 2019, consisting of $10.8 billion in cash and investments and $6.6 billion of revolving credit facility availability. Liquidity was offset by $4.4 billion of short-term debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Oct. 30, 2019, the company refinanced and increased its revolving commitments to $9.6 billion, including a $3.2 billion 364-day revolver, a $3.2 billion three-year revolver, and a $3.2 billion five-year revolver. The new $9.6 billion of revolving commitments back the CP program of the same size. Fitch views the increased size of the commercial paper program favorably, as it allows BA to finance more of the 737 MAX inventory build-up with short-term debt instead of long-term maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity needs will likely peak in 1Q20 or early 2Q20 as a result of continued MAX inventory build, the payment related to the close of the ERJ JV transaction, and a debt maturity. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could issue additional debt, which is incorporated into Fitch's forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of Sept. 30, 2019, was $24.7 billion ($22.8 billion attributable to BA, and $1.9 billion attributable to BCC), of which $4.4 billion is classified as short-term, including $2,990 million of CP. Most of the debt attributable to BCC consists of intercompany loans from BA to BCC; the last significant amount of debt originally issued by BCC and subsequently guaranteed by BA matured in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> issued $10.5 billion of long-term debt YTD in 2019. The delay in the approval of the Embraer transaction helped BA's liquidity, as it pushed BA's $4.2 billion payment into 2020 instead of late 2019 as originally expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s strong cash generation typically contributes to its liquidity position. The company generated $9.6 billion of FCF in 2018, but 2019 FCF will be substantially negative due to working capital build up related to the 737MAX. FCF was ($5.1 billion) after dividends in the first nine months of 2019; Fitch estimates the MAX had at least a $10.0 billion negative impact, leaving the rest of BA's operations generating approximately $5 billion of FCF. Fitch expects long term annual free cash will be at least at 2018 levels, or greater than $9 billion per year. Fitch expects FCF in 2020 and part of 2021 will be enhanced by the run-off of MAX inventories, partly offset by concessions to customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made $4.0 billion of discretionary pension contributions in 2017, including a $3.5 billion contribution in the form of company shares. This satisfied most required contributions for the next several years and Fitch does not expect pension contributions through the projection period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, we do not follow this process but instead look at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis. Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons. BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped making separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were consolidated.</p>

<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Capital Corporation</span>'s ratings are linked to its parent's ratings, <span class="companylink">The <b>Boeing</b> Company</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BA has an ESG relevance score of '4', updated from '3', for Management and Strategy due to 737 MAX challenges, which has had a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. Below average execution on the 737 MAX strategy has contributed to higher costs and potential reputational damage.</p>

</div><div>4484 words</div><div>17 January 2020</div><div>Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary</div><div>FITRA</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-17 January 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b> Company</span>'s (BA) long-term ratings to 'A-' from 'A' and short-term ratings to 'F2' from 'F1'. <b>Boeing</b> Capital's (BCC) long-term ratings have also been downgraded to 'A-' from 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade is based on continued regulatory risk regarding the timing and global sequencing of the 737 MAX's return-to-commercial service (RTCS). The logistical challenge of returning the planes to service and catching up on deliveries also drives the rating change, particularly considering the risk of rising supplier challenges with an extended 737 MAX production suspension. BA's substantial debt build-up over the past nine months is another downgrade factor. There is also uncertainty over the ultimate amount of concessions BA will make to airlines, with additional training requirements potentially adding to previous expectations. The MAX situation, including recently-released internal emails, is also likely to increase business risk from fines, litigation, weakened competitive position or reputation damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Stable Outlook reflects the performance of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s other businesses, which provide significant support at the current rating level. In addition, the Outlook incorporates expectations that BA has the potential to strengthen its credit profile via cash generation and debt reduction in the 3-4 quarters after 737 MAX deliveries resume. Overall, BA had a strong credit profile for its 'A' rating before the MAX grounding, and Fitch's ratings for the company incorporated the periodic stress periods that arise in the commercial aviation sector. Fitch's forecasts include significant conservatism for potentially higher cost related to the 737 MAX situation. Access to the capital markets and financial flexibility also support the Outlook. Fitch believes the lack of material 737 MAX cancelations since the grounding illustrates the aviation industry's continued support for the aircraft, which also supports the Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The MAX will likely be a concern throughout the aviation credit sector into 2021 as the airline industry catches up on delayed MAX deliveries. The MAX situation has reduced much of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financial cushion in the 'A' category, leaving the company more exposed to other unforeseen events or industry developments. In addition to the MAX, the company has a challenging agenda, including the <span class="companylink">Embraer S.A</span>. (ERJ, BBB-/Rating Watch Negative) joint venture transaction, 777X development, potential New Mid-Market Airplane (NMA) launch, and several planned production rate changes. Fitch also expects there will be a lingering operating margin impact for several years even after the MAX returns to commercial service. Other concerns include various lawsuits and investigations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s debt will nearly double in 2019 to around $27 billion as a result of $10.5 billion of long-term debt issuance and several billion dollars of commercial paper issuance. Debt will likely continue to rise in the first and second quarters of 2020, potentially peaking at more than $32 billion-$34 billion, before beginning to decline. In 2020 and 2021 Fitch expects <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> will pay down debt and reduce much of its commercial paper balance. Share repurchases remain a significant source of financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity needs will likely peak in 1Q20 or early 2Q20 as a result of continued 737 MAX cash usage, the payment related to the close of the ERJ joint venture transaction, and a debt maturity. If the MAX is not generating cash at this point, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could issue additional debt, which is incorporated into Fitch's forecasts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >737 MAX Grounding: Fitch views the MAX situation as partly an issue of timing unless substantial orders are cancelled. However, key uncertainties remain in addition to the unclear timing on RTCS. These include pilot training requirements, public perception of the MAX, negotiations with <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers over concessions, MAX valuations, aircraft finance impact, and lawsuits/investigations. There is also uncertainty surrounding the phasing of RTCS throughout the world. It is also clear that the role of regulators in the airplane certification process will change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes the aviation community is approaching the 737 MAX situation in a balanced manner. Fitch believes that the aviation sector sees this as temporary, is looking at the narratives in the final Lion Air accident report and preliminary accident reports, and notes the MAX's operating history prior to the grounding, which lasted more than a year and a half, with more than 200K flights and 30-40 million passengers by Fitch's estimates. The Lion Air final report was somewhat consistent with the preliminary report, and there were no real surprises. It confirmed that there were other contributing factors to the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The temporary suspension of 737 production should reduce cash burn related to the 737 MAX grounding by as much as half the estimated $1.5 billion monthly inventory build Fitch estimated prior to the suspension. BA will still spend money on employees and program fixed costs. Fitch also expects BA will use some cash to support some suppliers. In some respects, the suspension will be a negative for other related parties such as suppliers and airline customers. It should also increase program costs of the MAX, reducing long-term program margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Upcoming watch items include the Ethiopian final report, FAA certification test flight and fourth quarter earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ratings Incorporate Periodic Stress: The ratings are supported by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s demonstrated ability to withstand challenging periods such as the post-9/11 downturn, the most recent economic recession, and the 787/747-8 development delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s ratings reflect its strategic positions in the commercial aerospace and defense sectors, high barriers to entry in its key businesses, a solid liquidity position, substantial cash generation ability and $470 billion order backlog. Financial flexibility is another key rating strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has also earned credit for lowering its risk profile by shifting a substantial number of employees to defined contribution benefit plans, signing long-term labor agreements and successfully executing a significant number of aircraft production rate changes over the past several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition to the 737 MAX, concerns for <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> include M&A activity, the potential for delays and cost overruns on development programs, regular and substantial charges, the aging of parts of the company's defense portfolio and the size of the company's pension deficit on a GAAP basis at $15.3 billion at the end of 2018. The company is also susceptible to commercial aerospace industry shocks, such as downturns, terrorism and disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The company's portfolio is less balanced than it once was, as commercial growth reduced the weight of defense revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue. Growth of services offerings could improve <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s balance, diversification and margins. The intense competitiveness of the commercial airplane industry is also a rating consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The rating for BCC primarily reflects that BA has provided unconditional guarantees for the due and punctual payment and performance of all of BCC's outstanding publicly-issued debt. In addition to the guarantee, BCC's role arranging, structuring, and providing financing to support the sale of BA's products, the high level of management and operational integration between the two entities, BA's track record of support for BCC, and the fungibility of funding between the two entities further support Fitch's view of BCC as a core subsidiary of BA. Consistent with Fitch's 'Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria', the ratings of core subsidiaries are equalized with those of its parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC has historically exhibited sound operating performance, stable asset quality, and a sufficient liquidity profile, although its standalone credit risk profile would likely be lower than 'A-' given the cyclicality and residual value risk associated with the aircraft leasing business, the credit risk profile and concentration of BCC's lessors and its elevated leverage levels relative to standalone aircraft lessors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's revenues and operating income have remained relatively flat, driven by portfolio run-off and aircraft sales, offset by modest new origination activity. Asset quality has also remained relatively stable over the years, as the company has worked through a number of credit issues within its portfolio and reduced overall risk resulting from a decrease in customer financing. Fitch believes that current loss reserves, the current supportive aircraft financing environment, and improved airline credit fundamentals, provide adequate support relative to potential losses on receivables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s most immediate peer is <span class="companylink">Airbus SE</span> (A-/F1/Positive). Despite convergence in credit profiles over the past several years, several key credit factors still differentiate the two companies' ratings. Cash flow generation is one of the key differentiators between Airbus and <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> has consistently achieved better FCF and FFO over the past decade, due to better program execution and lower investment needs despite higher dividend payments. Cash generation should continue to grow at both companies, but <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s cash flow advantage is likely to persist once it gets past the 737 MAX grounding. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s business profile is also modestly stronger than Airbus' because of a more diverse revenue mix between commercial and defense. Both companies have strong balance sheets and liquidity positions, with Airbus generally operating with a higher net cash position than <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>. FX exposure is another key differentiator between <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and Airbus, with the former having little exposure and the latter have significant exposure, although Airbus has taken actions to lessen the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The 737 MAX groundings will be lifted in phases by different regions through early 2Q20. Deliveries in various regions will resume in 2020 shortly after the groundings are lifted;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total MAX inventory build will exceed $15 billion. While the 737 MAX is grounded and the production line is open, BA builds working capital at a rate of as much as $1.5 billion per month as a result of the 737 MAX deliveries shut-down. The production suspension reduces this by up to a half;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The 737 MAX program order backlog does not suffer material cancelations;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- BA gradually moves the 737 production rate back to the 42/month-52/month range starting in the second quarter of 2020, and raises the rate to 57/month late in 2020 or early 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The inventory of MAX aircraft assembled but undelivered during the grounding will be delivered throughout 2020 and into 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Margins are negatively affected by MAX-related costs in 2019 through 2021, but remain consistent with the rating in 2020 and 2021, with EBIT margin approximately 11%;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Concessions and other considerations for 737 MAX customers affected by the grounding will rise from the $6.1 billion amount already estimated and recognized by <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>-Embraer commercial joint venture closes in April or May of 2020. <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> finances its $4.2 billion payment to Embraer with cash and also consolidates approximately $3.0 billion of Embraer debt and a similar amount of cash;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Debt nearly doubles in 2019 to around $27 billion as a result of $10.5 billion of long-term debt issuance and several billion dollars of commercial paper issuance. Debt will likely rise further in the first quarter of 2020. In 2020 and 2021 <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> pays down debt and reduces much of its commercial paper balance;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Share repurchases remain suspended through 2020, then could resume in 2021, but at lower levels than in recent years;</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- BA launches the NMA in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Positive rating actions are not likely to be considered until the company returns the 737 MAX program to a stable condition and reduces debt taken on to fund inventory build related to the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--An improvement in the company's credit profile from higher commercial aircraft deliveries, debt reduction and pension contributions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Several initiatives to boost margins, if successful;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Modifying the cash deployment strategy to have less focus on share repurchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Substantial order cancellations and related material cost increases for the 737 MAX program;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material delays in resuming 737 MAX deliveries in a phased manner beyond the mid-year 2020 time frame;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Indications of materially higher business risk from regulatory challenges, fines, litigation, or reputation and brand damage from the 737 MAX situation;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material negative developments with any of the company's other major programs leading to delivery delays, order cancellations, large additional costs or inventory write-downs;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Large acquisitions, particularly combined with a sector downturn, or debt-funded share repurchases;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained consolidated FFO-adjusted leverage above 2.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained free cash flow margins below 3-4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC's ratings and Rating Outlook are linked to those of its parent. Positive rating actions would be limited to Fitch's view of BA's credit profile. Fitch cannot envisage a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than its parent. Conversely, negative rating actions could be driven by a change in BA's ratings or the early termination of the parent guarantee prior to the repayment of BCC's outstanding publicly issued debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> had a consolidated liquidity position of approximately $17.4 billion as of Sept. 30, 2019, consisting of $10.8 billion in cash and investments and $6.6 billion of revolving credit facility availability. Liquidity was offset by $4.4 billion of short-term debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On Oct. 30, 2019 the company refinanced and increased its revolving commitments to $9.6 billion, including a $3.2 billion 364-day revolver, a $3.2 billion three-year revolver, and a $3.2 billion five-year revolver. The new $9.6 billion of revolving commitments back the commercial paper program of the same size. Fitch views the increased size of the commercial paper program favorably, as it allows BA to finance more of the 737 MAX inventory build-up with short-term debt instead of long-term maturities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity needs will likely peak in 1Q20 or early 2Q20 as a result of continued MAX inventory build, the payment related to the close of the ERJ JV transaction, and a debt maturity. If the MAX is not generating cash at this point, <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> could issue additional debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Consolidated debt, as of Sept. 30, 2019, was $24.7 billion ($22.8 billion attributable to BA, and $1.9 billion attributable to BCC), of which $4.4 billion is classified as short-term, including $2,990 million of CP. Most of the debt attributable to BCC consists of intercompany loans from BA to BCC; the last significant amount of debt originally issued by BCC and subsequently guaranteed by BA matured in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> issued $10.5 billion of long-term debt in 2019. The delay in the approval of the Embraer transaction helped BA's liquidity, as it pushed BA's $4.2 billion payment into 2020 instead of late 2019 as originally expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s strong cash generation typically contributes to its liquidity position. The company generated $9.6 billion of FCF in 2018, but 2019 FCF will be substantially negative due to working capital build up related to the 737MAX. FCF was ($5.1 billion) after dividends in the first nine months of 2019; Fitch estimates the MAX had at least a $10 billion negative impact, leaving the rest of BA's operations generating approximately $5 billion of FCF. Fitch expects long term annual free cash will be at least at 2018 levels, or greater than $9 billion per year. Fitch expects FCF in 2020 and part of 2021 will be enhanced by the run-off of MAX inventories, partly offset by concessions to customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> made $4 billion of discretionary pension contributions in 2017, including a $3.5 billion contribution in the form of company shares. This satisfied most required contributions for the next several years and Fitch does not expect pension contributions through the projection period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >BCC Treatment: In most cases where an industrial company has a captive finance subsidiary Fitch deconsolidates the subsidiary and then evaluates the parent's financial statements treating the subsidiary as an equity investment. In the case of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>, Fitch does not follow this process but instead looks at financial metrics primarily on a consolidated basis. Fitch looks at <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> and BCC on a consolidated basis for several reasons. BCC evolved into a less significant part of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s financials as a result of the successful strategic shift to reduce BCC's emphasis on portfolio growth and increase focus on facilitating third-party financing for customers. BCC's primary strategic mission is not regular lending to <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span>'s customers, but only occasionally financing aircraft, with approximately 99% of the company's deliveries typically financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The financial information Fitch has for BCC is not as detailed as is typically the case with industrial finance captives. In early 2013 <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> fully guaranteed all of BCC's outstanding debt, which is also not typical of the industrial finance captives rated by Fitch. BCC stopped making separate SEC filings. In general, Fitch's approach of consolidating BCC's financial statements is a more conservative approach to the credit analysis of <span class="companylink"><b>Boeing</b></span> than if BCC were consolidated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Public Ratings with Credit Linkage to other ratings</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.</p>

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>
