<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-25 February 2025: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp.</span>'s (OXY) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB-'. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> has also revised the Rating Outlook to Positive from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The main driver of the Positive Outlook is the company's accelerated debt repayment and strong line of sight on additional debt repayment, including $1.2 billion in announced divestitures by Q125.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s ratings reflect its large size and liquids-weighted profile, competitive netbacks, anchor position in the Permian, and above-average diversification versus upstream peers, including chemicals and midstream. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s ratings also reflect somewhat elevated interest costs and debt levels relative to peers (including preferred interest cost), as well as higher near-term capex spending. The company achieved its near-term debt reduction targets ahead of schedule following the <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Accelerated Debt Reduction: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> achieved its $4.5 billion short-term debt reduction target on an accelerated basis with a combination of $1.7 billion in asset sales and FCF. It also pre-announced $1.2 billion in divestitures by 1Q25, which should further accelerate debt repayment to at least $5.7 billion, prior to the use of FCF for deleveraging. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates the company will reach upgrade FFO coverage sensitivities around 18 months from now, but this timeline could change depending on the pace of debt repayments and any incremental asset divestitures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Expensive But High-Quality Acquisition: The $12.5 billion <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> deal was a leveraging deal expensive on both a $/net acre and $/flowing basis, yet added around 160kboepd of high margin production in the core of the Midland Basin. <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> was a factor in strong 2024 performance, and <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> properties saw a reduction of 8% in drilling days and 18% in completion costs yoy. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> expects savings of more than $1 million per well across its remaining Midland Basin program in 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Large Diversified Upstream: At 1.46 million boepd, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is one of the largest and most diversified independent E&Ps. Production is split between U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore and the Powder River Basin) and international locations (Algeria, Oman, UAE and Qatar). The <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> acquisition further reweighted output toward the U.S. Proved reserves rose to 4.6 billion boe in 2024 (230% all-in reserve replacement ratio and 112% organic ratio), driven by strong extensions and recoveries (+326MM boe) and favorable revisions of previous estimates (+170MMboe).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Business Model: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s integrated business model provides modest earnings diversification through chemicals and midstream. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given feedstock advantages and limited reinvestment. An expansion of the Battleground, TX chlor-alkali plant in 2026 should add $325 million in recurring incremental EBITDA. Midstream has been weighed down by weak Permian-Gulf coast crude differentials, but was partly offset by gas marketing optimization. Midstream should also benefit from the roll-off of two out-of-the-money transportation contracts this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Reasonable Metrics: As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>, for the year ending Dec. 31, 2024 <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s leverage was 2.5x and FCF was just over $2.8 billion. FFO interest coverage (including the impact of preferred interest) was weaker than peers at 6.7x but should improve with additional de-leveraging. In line with its capital allocation framework, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF after dividends will be dedicated to near-term debt repayment. Separately, in line with <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s hybrid criteria, the 50% equity credit for the preferreds was eliminated due to economic incentives to redeem or refinance this high coupon instrument in less than five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Carbon Initiatives: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s low carbon initiatives are centered around creating carbon sequestration hubs. This includes the construction of the world's largest direct air capture (DAC) plant in TX, which is 94% complete and is expected to come online this year. While considerable uncertainty remains around ultimate costs and returns of DAC technology as well as subsidy support, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s overall capital commitments to low carbon initiatives are modest, at less than $600 million per year over the next two years, which limits the impact to the company's credit quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With Q324 upstream production of 1.41 million boepd, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is one of the largest independents, larger than peers <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (728kboepd), <span class="companylink">Coterra Energy</span> (670kboepd), Ovintiv Corporation (593kboepd), <span class="companylink">Diamondback</span> (584kboepd), and <span class="companylink">APA Corporation</span> (467kboepd). Domestically, only <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (1.69 million boepd consolidated) is larger. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s liquids weighting of 75% is on the high end, while recent cash netbacks ($24.3/boe at Q324) were above average relative to diversified peers, but below Permian pure plays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Geographic diversification is above average, with upstream production split between the U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, and the Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a leading producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America), and a large Permian producer, supplemented by the recent CrownRock acquisition in the Midland basin. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s integrated business model provides modest additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which sets it apart from peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, financial flexibility (including FFO interest coverage) is somewhat lower than IG peers given the impact of the remaining preferreds and incremental transaction debt incurred to fund <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span>, although the company has made accelerated progress on debt reduction initiatives since transaction close. While the company's interest coverage is likely to remain relatively low, this is partly offset by the company's strong business profile. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Base Case WTI oil prices of $65/bbl in 2025, $60/bbl in 2026 and 2027, and $57/bbl in the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Henry Hub natural gas prices of $2.50 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2025 and $2.75 across the remainder of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Total production of 1,424kboepd in 2025, rising to 1,470kboepd by the end of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Company repays just under $9.5 billion in debt over forecast, with repayment frontloaded in 2025 and 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-- Only moderate additional asset sales assumed across the forecast beyond what was announced for 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Midcycle EBITDA leverage above 3.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Midcycle FFO interest coverage approaching 5.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shift toward a less conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Midcycle FFO interest coverage approaching 7.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material incremental reduction in interest expense or gross debt levels;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Midcycle EBITDA leverage below 2.2x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As of YE24, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s cash on hand was $2.13 billion, excluding restricted cash of $25 million. There was no draw on the company's committed senior unsecured revolver (which was upsized from $4.0 billion to $4.15 billion in May 2024, with a maturity extension to June 2028) for core liquidity of $6.28 billion. The only financial covenant associated with the revolver was a max debt/capitalization ratio of 65%. Separately, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> had full availability on a $600 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination and matures July 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a large, diversified E&P with upstream operations in the U.S. and MENA. Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and midstream and marketing, which includes low carbon ventures. Q424 production was 1.46 million boepd.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-19 July 2024: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp.</span>'s (OXY) proposed senior unsecured notes issuance. Proceeds from the notes will be used to partly fund <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s acquisition of <span class="companylink">Permian</span> producer <span class="companylink">CrownRock, L.P.</span>, and related refinancing transactions. The new notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption provision in the event the acquisition does not close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s behalf, <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> issued a notice to redeem all of its legacy 5.625% 2025 notes. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> simultaneously announced an obligor exchange for any and all of <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span>'s 5.00% 2029 notes. The new notes will have the same interest rate and maturity as the exchanged notes, but with <span class="companylink">OXY</span> as the obligor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In addition, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> disclosed that its Permian joint venture (JV) partner <span class="companylink">Ecopetrol</span> intends to exercise a contractual right to acquire a 30% working interest in <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> for approximately $3.6 billion, prior to adjustments. If consummated, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> expects to use proceeds from this sale to accelerate debt repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s ratings reflect its large size and liquids-weighted profile, competitive netbacks, anchor position in the Permian, and the impact of deleveraging over the past few years, as well as above-average diversification versus peers. Rating concerns include the impact of incremental leverage from the <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> acquisition; elevated interest costs and debt relative to peers, potential execution risk around asset sales, and higher near-term capex spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High-Quality Expensive Acquisition: On a consolidated basis, the acquisition of <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> will add 94.4k net acres in the core of the Midland basin in Marin, Howard, Glasscock, and Upton counties, and more than quadruple <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s sub-$40 in the Midland basin, as well as add around 170kboepd of high margin, high liquids pro forma production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, the approximately $12.5 billion <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> deal is expensive on both a debt/net acre and debt/flowing basis (USD128k/net acre and USD79k/flowing barrel, respectively, versus recent Permian transaction medians in the USD 53k/net acre and USD 44k/flowing barrel range).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leveraging Transaction: The transaction is leveraging relative to recent peer transactions with an 80+%-debt component, and temporarily reverses the headroom <span class="companylink">OXY</span> built over the past few years by adding over $10 billion in debt. To support de-leveraging, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> will allocate all FCF after dividends, as well as asset sale proceeds, to balance sheet reduction, with a target of principal debt below $15 billion, including a $4.5 billion to be repaid within one year of close. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> also has a $4.5 billion-$6.0 billion asset sales target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the repayment plan has some execution risk but is credible, with reasonable line of sight over the next several quarters, including the previously mentioned 30% working interest sale. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s credit metrics will remain within bounds for a 'BBB-' under base case assumptions (WTI oil prices of $65/bbl in 2025, $60 in 2026 and 2027, and $57 in the long term), but notes a sustained drop in oil prices would be a key risk for repayment given the lack of hedges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> enjoys modest but meaningful diversification through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in basic chemicals in North America, and midstream. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given limited reinvestment tailwinds due to solid domestic demand and feedstock cost advantages, as well as Russia sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The midstream segment has been weighed down by weak Permian-Houston differentials, but the impact of these should be reduced by contract roll-offs and gradual widening of spreads in line with increasing Permian production. OxyChem's project to expand capacity 80% at the Battleground, TX chlor-alkali plant should be complete in 2026, and is expected to contribute $300 million-$400 million in incremental EBITDA once up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong 2023 Results: The combination of strong hydrocarbon prices and lower debt and interest costs has resulted in robust pre-transaction credit metrics for standalone <span class="companylink">OXY</span>. As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>, for FY 2023, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s EBITDA leverage stood at 1.5x, FFO interest coverage at 6.8x, and FCF of $4.55 billion. Contributions from midstream & marketing were limited due to continued narrowness in crude differentials. In line with the company's revised capital allocation framework, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF after dividends will be substantially dedicated to transaction debt repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Carbon Initiatives: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s commitment to scope 3 emissions stands out versus U.S. E&P peers, and is centered around creating carbon sequestration hubs. This includes the construction of the world's largest direct air capture (DAC) plant at 0.5 million metric tons of CO2, with operation expected mid-2025. Considerable uncertainty remains around ultimate costs and returns of DAC technology despite subsidy support. In 4Q23, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> entered a JV with <span class="companylink">BlackRock</span> to help fund DAC plant 1 for $550 million, which is consistent with management statements about using substantial third-party funding if it scales the business up. Currently OLCV does not comprise a large portion of <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s total budget, which limits its impact on credit quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With 1Q24 standalone production of 1.18 million boepd <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is one of the largest independents, significantly larger than Ovintiv Corporation (574 kboepd), <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (664 kboepd), <span class="companylink">APA Corporation</span> (389 kboepd), and Marathon Corporation (369 kboepd). Only <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (1.67 million boepd consolidated) is larger. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s liquids weighting at around 75% is also above average, while cash netbacks ($34.1/boe at 1Q24) were above average relative to diversified peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Geographic diversification is above average, with E&P operations split among the U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a leading producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and a large Permian producer, with one of the biggest net acreage positions in that basin, split between unconventional and EOR. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which sets it apart from peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, debt and interest expense are higher than IG peers given the impact of the remaining preferreds and high amount of transaction debt incurred to fund <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span>, although there is good line of sight on repayment. While the company's interest coverage is likely to remain relatively low, this is offset by the company's strong business profile. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $65/bbl in 2025, $60/bbl in 2026 and 2027, and $57/bbl in the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $2.50 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2024, $3.00 in 2025 and 2026, and $2.75/mcf in the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> acquisition funded as guided;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Company repays a material portion of transaction debt using proceeds from FCF and asset sales in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 7.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle EBITDA leverage below 2.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material incremental reduction in interest expense or gross debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained decline in FCF generation that limits ability to meet near-term debt repayment targets;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Failure to repay a material portion of transaction debt in the 6-12 months following <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> close;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 5.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle EBITDA leverage above 3.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shift towards a less conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >As of 1Q24, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s cash on hand was $1.272 billion, excluding restricted cash of $61 million. There was no draw on the company's committed senior unsecured revolver (which was subsequently upsized from $4.0 billion to $4.15 billion on May 16, 2024) for core liquidity of $5.42 billion. The only financial covenant associated with the revolver was a max debt/capitalization ratio of 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Separately, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> had full availability on a $600 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination and matures December 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a large diversified E&P with upstream operations in the U.S. (Permian, DJ, Gulf of Mexico (GoM), Powder River Basin) and MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and Midstream and Marketing, including Low Carbon Ventures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-12 December 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp.</span>'s (OXY) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB-', and maintained the Stable Rating Outlook following the announced acquisition of <span class="companylink">Permian</span> producer <span class="companylink">CrownRock, LP.</span>
                     </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While the <span class="companylink">CrownRock, LP</span> (BB- IDR) acquisition is relatively expensive and leveraging (over $10 billion in new and assumed debt expected), this is largely offset by <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s strong standalone FCF generation capability and credible path to near-term debt reduction through FCF and asset sales. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s credit metrics will remain within bounds for the 'BBB-' rating under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s base case assumptions. The transaction should also benefit <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s business profile by adding around 170kboepd of high-quality, liquids-rich Permian production, increasing pro forma production to around 1.4 million boepd from 1.22 million boepd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s ratings reflect its large size and liquids-weighted profile, competitive netbacks, anchor position in the Permian, and the impact of deleveraging activity over the past few years. The ratings also reflect above-average diversification versus upstream peers, including chemicals and midstream. Rating concerns include elevated interest costs and debt relative to peers, higher near-term capex spending, and the impact of incremental leverage from the <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High-Quality But Expensive Acquisition: The acquisition of <span class="companylink">Permian</span> company <span class="companylink">CrownRock, LP</span> will add 94.4k net acres in the core of the Midland basin in Marin, Howard, Glasscock, and Upton counties, and more than quadruple <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s sub-$40 in the Midland basin, as well as adding around 170kboepd (pro forma 2024) of high margin, high liquids production, boosting <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s upstream production from 1.22 million boepd to around 1.4 million boepd. At the same time, at $12.0 billion, <span class="companylink">Crownrock</span> is expensive on both a debt/net acre and debt/flowing basis (USD128k/net acre and USD79k/flowing barrel, respectively, versus recent Permian transaction medians in the USD 53k/net acre and USD 44k/flowing barrel range).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Leveraging Transaction: The transaction is leveraging relative to recent peer transactions with an 80+%-debt component, and will temporarily reverse the headroom <span class="companylink">OXY</span> built over the past few years by adding over $10 billion in debt, including assumed <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> debt. To support its goal of accelerated de-leveraging, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> announced a revised financial policy to allocate all FCF after common dividends, as well as asset sale proceeds, to balance sheet reduction, with a target of principal debt below $15 billion, including a near-term target of $4.5 billion to be repaid within one year of transaction close. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the repayment plan has some execution risk but is credible, with reasonable line of sight for accelerated debt repayment over the next several quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s credit metrics will remain within bounds of the 'BBB-' rating under base case assumptions (WTI oil prices of $70/bbl in 2024, $65/bbl in 2025, and $60/bbl in 2026) but notes a sustained drop in oil prices would be a key risk for repayment given the lack of hedges at <span class="companylink">OXY</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> enjoys modest but meaningful diversification through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in basic chemicals in North America, and its midstream segment. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given limited reinvestment tailwinds due to solid domestic demand and feedstock cost advantages, as well as Russia sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The midstream segment has been weighed down by weak Permian-Houston differentials, but the impact of these should be reduced by contract roll-offs and gradual widening of spreads in line with increasing Permian production. OxyChem's project to expand capacity 80% at the Battleground, MI chlor-alkali plant should be complete in 2026, and is expected to contribute $300 million-$400 million in incremental EBITDA once up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong YTD 2023 Results: The combination of strong hydrocarbon prices and lower debt and interest costs has resulted in robust pre-transaction credit metrics for standalone <span class="companylink">OXY</span>. As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>, for the period ending Sept 30, 2023, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s EBITDA leverage stood at 1.5x, FFO interest coverage was 8.3x, and FCF was $5.36 billion. Contributions from midstream & marketing were limited due to continued narrowness in Midland to Houston crude differentials. In line with the company's revised capital allocation framework, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects FCF after dividends will be substantially dedicated to transaction debt repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Incremental Preferred Redemption: In the third quarter, on a standalone basis, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> redeemed an additional $342 million in Berkshire preferreds, bringing total redemptions YTD to $1.51 billion, about 15% of the $10 billion outstanding. This should reduce run rate interest expense by about $121 million and exceeds earlier anticipated levels. The rules around redemptions are onerous, and include the need to maintain a $4.00/share pay out on a rolling 12-month basis, pay a redemption price of 110%, and repurchase an equal amount of preferred stock for common share distributions. Given lower oil prices, the rolling 12-month cumulative distributions to common shareholders fell below the minimum levels required for mandatory redemption. Cumulatively, since the close of the Anadarko acquisition, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has retired over $26 billion in debt,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher Capex: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s 2023 capex for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023 was approximately $4.7 billion, which puts it on track to achieve the upper end of earlier capex guidance of $5.4 billion- $6.2 billion, an approximately 35% increase above 2022 levels, and well above stand-alone maintenance capital of $3.5 billion. Most of the higher capex was spent on upstream activity but other drivers included OxyChem's chlor-alkali expansion project and increased spending for Low Carbon projects. Pro forma for the acquisition, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s 2024 capex guidance is $7.3 billion-$7.5 billion, of which $900 million is earmarked for <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Carbon Initiatives: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s commitment to scope 3 emissions stands out versus U.S. E&P peers, and is centered around creating carbon sequestration hubs using its geologic formations. This includes the construction of the world's largest direct air capture (DAC) plant at 0.5 million metric tons of CO2, (30% complete) with operation expected mid-2025. Considerable uncertainty remains around ultimate costs and returns of DAC technology despite subsidy support. In November, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> entered a JV with <span class="companylink">BlackRock</span> to help fund DAC plant 1 for $550 million, which is consistent with management statements that they expect to shift to substantial third party funding if it scales the business up. Currently OLVC does not comprise a large portion of <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s total budget, which limits its impact on credit quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Following the acquisition of <span class="companylink">CrownRock L.P.</span> the company's production will rise to just under 1.4 million boepd on a pro forma basis (3Q23 standalone production 1.22 million boepd), making <span class="companylink">OXY</span> among the largest independents, significantly larger than Ovintiv Corporation (572 kboepd), <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (665 kboepd), <span class="companylink">APA Corporation</span> (412 kboepd), and Marathon Corporation (422 kboepd). Only <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (1.58 million boepd consolidated) is larger. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s liquids weighting at around 76% is also above average, while cash netbacks ($42.6/boe at Q32) were above average relative to diversified peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Geographic diversification is above average, with E&P operations split between the U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a leading producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and a large Permian producer, with one of the biggest net acreage positions in that basin, split between unconventional and EOR. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which sets it apart from peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s debt and interest expense are higher than IG peers given the impact of the remaining preferreds and high amount of transaction debt incurred to fund <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span>, although there is good line of sight on repayment. While the company's interest coverage is likely to remain relatively low, this is offset by the company's strong business profile. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $70/bbl in 2024, $65/bbl in 2025, $60/bbl in 2026, and $57/bbl in 2027;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $3.25 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2024, $3.00 in 2025, and $2.75/mcf in 2026 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Pro forma production of just under 1.4 million boepd in 2024 which edges up to 1.43 million boepd by the end of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--<span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> acquisition funded as guided;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Asset sales of just under $4.3 billion completed in 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Company aggressively repays transaction debt using proceeds from FCF and asset sales, with a material portion of debt repaid in the near term; debt by end of forecast expected to fall to below current (pre-transaction) debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 7.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle EBITDA leverage below 2.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material incremental reduction in interest expense or gross debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained decline in FCF generation that limits ability to meet near-term debt repayment targets;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Failure to repay a material portion of transaction debt in the 6-12 months following <span class="companylink">CrownRock</span> close;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 5.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle EBITDA leverage above 3.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shift towards a less conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >On a standalone basis, at Sept. 30, 2023 <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s cash on hand was $611 million, excluding restricted cash of $38 million, and there was no draw on the company's committed $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolver due June 30, 2025, for core liquidity of just over $4.6 billion. The only financial covenant associated with the revolver was a max debt/capitalization ratio of 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Separately, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> had full availability on a $600 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination and matures December 2024. The company's financial flexibility in terms of maturity wall is likely to move lower once transaction financing is in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a large diversified E&P with upstream operations in the U.S. (Permian, DJ, Gulf of Mexico (GoM), Powder River Basin) and MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and Midstream and Marketing, including Low Carbon Ventures. 3Q23 production was 1.22 million boepd. Following the proposed acquisition of <span class="companylink">CrownRock L.P.</span> the company's PF production will rise to just under 1.4 million boepd.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-New York-16 May 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Operating, LP</span>'s (Western) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. The senior unsecured notes are also upgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'/'RR4'. A Stable Rating Outlook has been assigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The upgrade is primarily driven by the upgrade of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (BBB-/Stable). Occidental is Western's largest counterparty and in <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s opinion, is expected to contribute approximately 60% of Western's 2023 revenues. Western's ratings reflect its favorable size, contracted cashflows lacking material commodity exposure and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s expectation that leverage will remain at or below 3.5x going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Credit Supportive Financial Policy: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes Western's financial policy is credit supportive. Management has committed to leverage below 3.5x going forward. Capex needs are manageable, and the company will continue to generate excess cashflows. The company used a portion of the excess cash to pay back approximately $504 million in senior notes in 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, Management increased per unit distributions by approximately 53%. Going forward, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Western to continue to balance dividends, share buy backs and growth capital spending while remaining within leverage targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong Contract Profile: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes Western will generate over 90% of its throughput from fee-based and fixed-price contracts in 2023. Western has limited direct commodity price exposure, and has also diversified geographically, supported by a blend of contracts with minimum volume commitment (MVCs) and/or cost of service (COS) components, relative to the more standard requirements contracts prevalent in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Approximately 77% of Western's natural gas throughput volume was protected by either MVCs or COS components in 2022, and approximately 100% of its crude oil and natural gas liquids (each excluding equity investments) and 90% of produced-water throughput were also supported by either MVCs or COS components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Throughput Volumes to Remain Flat: Relatively flat levels of capex and exploration and production (E&P) activities, particularly from Occidental are expected to keep volume increases in the low single digits. However, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> projects a greater increase in EBITDA, from lower costs and partially from changes in some of the contracts where Western is now responsible for delivering fixed natural gas liquids (NGL) recoveries rather than actual NGL recoveries. This provision shifts a portion of the operating risk to Western as the operator, but also presents the opportunity to benefit from better than expected operating performance through the sale of the excess volumes recovered. Overall, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> views this construct as marginally more additive to risk, but not a material consideration at this point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2023, Western is expected to generate approximately 55% of EBITDA from the Delaware Basin, 29% of EBITDA from the DJ Basin, 8% from other non-core regions and 8% from equity investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Shorter-Term Contracts: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s rating case assumes the economic value of the contracts between Occidental and Western remains intact, with no renegotiation of contract terms deemed materially unfavorable to Western. Western's long-term weighted average contract life is 6 years to 10 years (other than the life-of-lease contracts) collectively for its gas, crude oil and water businesses at YE 2022. Western also has a portfolio of equity investments, including ownership interests in long-haul pipelines in the Permian, which should maintain stable cash flow in the near term. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes the <span class="companylink">Permian</span> will remain Western's cornerstone of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Sponsor Relationship: Occidental continues to reduce its ownership stake in Western's publicly traded parent, <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Partners, LP</span> (WES), now standing at 48.3% of limited partner interest, but retains 100% of the general partnership interest. Occidental contributed approximately 55% of Western's revenues in 2022, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Occidental's contribution to be in that area over the near term. Occidental's operational and financial strength influence Western's credit profile as Western depends on Occidental for future growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes Western's midstream operations will remain strategically important to Occidental's production, particularly in the Permian Basin. The operational alignment between Occidental and Western in the Permian remains intact in the long term, given the good fit between legacy <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum Corporation</span>'s (rating withdrawn) and Western's assets in the basin. However, Occidental reeling back legacy Anadarko's historic focus on the DJ Basin has impeded Western's growth in that basin. Western also targets growth through third-party volumes, but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> believes such growth could be somewhat slower as upstream customers remain increasingly capital disciplined regarding production spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary Relationship: <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> analyzed the parent-subsidiary relationship between Western and Occidental, and has determined that their respective IDRs are the same based on the companies' standalone credit profiles. Western maintains a separate board of directors and financing function. Outside of the <span class="companylink">PSL</span> relationship, as Western's largest counterparty, Occidental's rating and Outlook have credit implications for Western.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western primarily operates in the Delaware and DJ Basins. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects Western will derive about 60% of its 2023 revenue from Occidental. <span class="companylink">EQM Midstream Partners, LP</span> (BB/Negative) is one of Western's peers that operates primarily in the Appalachian Basin and has material, concentrated counterparty exposure to <span class="companylink">EQT Corporation</span> (BB+/Stable). <span class="companylink">EnLink Midstream, LLC</span> (BBB-/Stable) operate in multiple basins and is more diverse than Western.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Over 90% of Western's gas contracts and 100% of its liquids throughput (each excluding equity investments) are fee based, largely with MVC or COS provisions. By comparison, 90% of EnLink's gross margins are fee-based and EQM had approximately 65% of revenues from firm reservation fees for the YE 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In terms of EBITDA, Western generated about $2.1 billion in 2022, which is larger than EQM, DCP and EnLink. However, each of the peers is sizable, generating over $1 billion in EBITDA annually. With leverage expected below 3.5x for YE 2023, Western's leverage is expected to be lower than Enlink's and EQM's. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> calculates leverage of approximately 4.0x for EnLink and 5.3x for EQM for YE 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $80/barrel in 2023, $70 in 2024, $60 in 2025, and $50 in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $3.50/mcf in 2023 and 2024, $3.00/mcf in 2025, and $2.75/mcf in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Declining throughput volume in segments outside the Permian through 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Distributions as per management's forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No adverse changes in existing contract terms between Western and its major counterparties that would materially impair Western's expected cash flow;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No significant change in the financial policy due to potential ownership changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Asset and business line expansion leading to a more diversified cash flow profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA Leverage at or below 3.5x, with gross margin remaining above 90% fee based or fixed priced;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Favorable rating action at Occidental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--EBITDA Leverage at or above 4.5x on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Materially unfavorable changes in contract mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative rating action at Occidental;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative changes in law -- either new laws or rulings on old laws -- that cause volumetric declines and push profitability lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Western had approximately $112.6 million in cash, $5.1 million in outstanding LOC and $495.0 million of outstanding borrowing at March 31, 2023, resulting in approximately $1.5 billion available on its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF). <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects liquidity will remain adequate over the near term. In April 2023, WES repaid all the outstanding borrowing on its revolver resulting in full availability of $2.0 billion. Its maturity date is extended to April 2028.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With full availability on its revolver, strong cash flows and a manageable debt maturity schedule, Western has sufficient liquidity. The credit facility requires Western to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio at or below 5.0x, or a consolidated leverage ratio of 5.5x for quarters ending in the 270-day period immediately following certain acquisitions. Western is in compliance with this covenant, and <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects it will remain so for the balance of the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western is a subsidiary of WES, which, in turn, is a publicly traded master limited partnership (<span class="companylink">MLP</span>), the general partner of which is owned by <b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp. Western owns, operates, acquires and develops midstream energy assets generating its cash flow primarily from the Delaware Basin within the Permian and the DJ Basin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Operating, LP</span> has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Group Structure as the company operates under a somewhat complex group structure of master limited partnership, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the ratings in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-16 May 2023: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>.'s (OXY) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BB+', and upgraded <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s senior unsecured ratings to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'/'RR4.' The Rating Outlook is Stable. The main driver of the upgrade was the improvement in midcycle credit metrics, stemming from the combination of incremental de-leveraging, along with anticipated improvements in midcycle earnings in the chemicals and midstream segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s ratings reflect its large size and liquids-weighted profile, competitive netbacks, anchor position in the Permian, and the impact of ongoing deleveraging activity. The ratings also reflect a manageable maturity wall, and above-average diversification versus upstream peers, including chemicals and midstream. Rating concerns include somewhat elevated interest costs and debt relative to peers, higher near-term capex spending, uncertainty around funding and costs for <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s low carbon ventures, and the potential impacts of a macroeconomic slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Redemptions Improve Coverage: The main driver of the upgrade was incremental deleveraging. In Q1, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> announced it accrued redemptions for $647 million in preferred stock, eliminating an incremental $52 million in run-rate dividend expense. The rules around preferred redemptions are onerous, and include the need to maintain a $4.00/share pay out on a rolling 12-month basis, pay a redemption price of 110%, and repurchase an equal amount of preferred stock for common share distributions. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates the company will maximize the current window and purchase additional preferreds in 2023, but may switch back to debt repayment in 2024, assuming lower oil prices. In addition, the company repaid an incremental $22 million in 8.75% notes in Q1. Cumulatively, since the close of the Anadarko acquisition, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has retired over $26 billion in debt, including $10.5 billion in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Non E&P Improvements: Earnings are set to improve in the company's chemicals and midstream & marketing segments, driven by new projects and contract roll-offs. In OxyChem, this includes the membrane conversion project at OxyChem's Battleground chlor-alkali plant, which will expand capacity by 80% by 2026. This project, in conjunction with other smaller near-term expansions, will contribute $300 million-$400 million in incremental EBITDA. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> recently increased midpoint guidance for OxyChem's 2023 pre-tax income to $1.5 billion. In midstream & marketing, the roll-off of out-of-the money pipeline contracts is also expected to create earnings uplift beginning in 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong 2022 Results: The combination of strong hydrocarbon prices and lower debt and interest costs has resulted in robust near-term credit metrics. As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>, at YE 2022, the company's EBITDA leverage declined to 1.1x, FFO interest coverage rose to 8.7x, and FCF was a record high of just over $11 billion. Contributions from midstream & marketing were limited due to continued narrowness in Midland to Houston crude differentials, but chemicals contributions were robust. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates positive but declining FCF generation over the next few years under our base case price deck. In line with the company's capital allocation framework, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates modest incremental de-leveraging as FCF will be increasingly dedicated to shareholder distributions. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> does not systematically hedge its upstream production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Maturity Wall Manageable: Following refinancing and debt repayments, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s near-term wall is moderate. As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>, maturities due over the next few years (excluding puttable 2036 bonds) include nothing due in 2023, $1.06 billion due 2024, $1.21 billion in 2025, and $1.45 billion in 2026. The combination of cash balances, full availability on the company's unsecured revolver, and strong projected FCF should comfortably address the near-term maturity schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> enjoys modest but meaningful diversification through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in basic chemicals in North America, and its midstream segment. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given limited reinvestment tailwinds due to solid domestic demand and feedstock cost advantages, as well as Russia sanctions. The midstream segment has historically been weighed down by weak Permian-Houston differentials, but the impact of these should be reduced by contract roll-offs and gradual widening of spreads in line with increasing Permian production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher Capex: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is guiding to higher capex spending in 2023, with projected spending of $5.4 billion-$6.2 billion, an approximately 30% increase above 2022 levels, and well above maintenance capital of $3.5 billion, which itself rose from $3.2 billion due to higher production, and growth projects including the OxyChem chlor-alkali expansion, as well increased spending for Low Carbon projects. The company is seeing inflation in the upstream in the U.S. in the 15% range, with inflation in international upstream lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Carbon Reduction Initiatives: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s commitment to scope 3 emissions stands out versus U.S. E&P peers, and is centered around creating carbon sequestration hubs using its geologic formations. This includes the construction of the world's largest direct air capture (DAC) plant at 1 million metric tons of CO2, with operation expected mid-2025, slightly delayed vs earlier estimates. While the economics of the DAC plant have improved following passage of the IRA, there is considerable uncertainty around ultimate costs and returns, as well as long-term financing plans. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is self-funding the first DAC plant but <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> expects this will shift to substantial third party funding if it scales the business up. For now, OLVC does not comprise a large portion of <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s total budget, which limits its impact on credit quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s debt and interest expense are somewhat higher than IG peers given the high amount of transaction debt incurred to fund the Anadarko acquisition. However, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has since repaid a substantial amount of gross debt, and has begun to address the preferreds. While interest coverage is likely to remain relatively low, this is offset by the company's strong business profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In terms of size and scale, at 1,159kboepd in production from continuing operations in FY 2022, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is among the largest independents, significantly larger than <span class="companylink">Ovintiv Corporation</span> (510.1kboepd), <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (610.7kboepd), <span class="companylink">APA Corporation</span> (386.8boepd), and Marathon Corporation (342.5kboepd). Only <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (1,518.2kboepd) is larger. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s liquids weighting at around 76% is also above average, while <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s cash netbacks ($43.4/boe at YE 2022) are in line with diversified peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Geographic diversification is above-average, with E&P operations split between the U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a leading producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and a large Permian producer, with one of the biggest net acreage positions (2.8 million acres, split roughly between Permian unconventional shale, and EOR). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which sets it apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $80/barrel in 2023, $70 in 2024, $60 in 2025, and $50 in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $3.50/mcf in 2023 and 2024, $3.00/mcf in 2025, and $2.75/mcf in 2026;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex of $5.8 billion in 2023, which declines to just under $5.6 billion by the end of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Production volumes of 1.19 million boepd in 2023 rising to 1.25 million boepd by the end of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Company assumed to redeem $1.1 billion in 8% Berkshire preferreds in 2023 and switches back to moderate gross debt reduction over the remainder of the forecast as oil prices moderate;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Increased FCF allocation to share repurchases and dividends, in line with company's shareholder return framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 7.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle EBITDA leverage below 2.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Material incremental reduction in interest expense or gross debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 5.0x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle EBITDA leverage above 3.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shift towards a less conservative financial policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash on hand as of YE 2022 was $984 million, excluding restricted cash of $42 million, and there was no draw on the company's committed $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolver due June 30, 2025, for core liquidity of just under $5.0 billion. The only financial covenant associated with the revolver was a max debt/capitalization ratio of 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Separately, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> had full availability on a $600 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination and matures December 2024. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s maturity wall is manageable given the impact of recent debt repayments focusing on 2022-2026 maturities, as well as good liquidity and strong projected FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a large diversified E&P with upstream operations in the U.S. (Permian, DJ, Gulf of Mexico (GoM), Powder River Basin) and MENA n (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and Midstream and Marketing.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-25 May 2022: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (OXY) at 'BB+' and senior unsecured rating at 'BB+'/'RR4'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. The main driver was <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s accelerated debt reduction. Including the May 2022 tender, the company will have reduced its pro forma debt by around $8.1 billion since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s ratings reflect its large size and liquids-weighted profile, competitive netbacks, anchor position in the Permian, and the impact of ongoing debt reductions. The ratings also reflect a manageable maturity wall, and above-average diversification versus upstream peers, including chemicals and midstream. Rating concerns include high interest costs associated with the Anadarko acquisition (including $800 million in preferred dividends), and demand destruction risks in the current environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Repayment Accelerates: The change in Outlook was primarily driven by accelerated de-leveraging. This includes approximately $3.3 billion in debt reduction in Q1, comprised of a $2.9 billion multi-tranche tender, a repurchased note, and open market repurchases. Following an additional $300 million in open market repurchases and the $4.5 billion May tender, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> will have reduced its debt on a pro forma basis by around $8.1 billion since the beginning of the year. At the same time, the impact of the most recent tender on interest burden was more limited given the large amount of zero coupon notes ($1.34 billion) that were redeemed in this exercise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong FCF: As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s LTM FCF for the period ending March 31, 2022 rose to approximately $8.7 billion versus $6.7 billion in 2021, driven by significantly higher oil and gas prices, as well as robust performance in non-oil segments. Oxychem delivered record earnings in Q1 2022, and increased its pre-tax income guidance to $2.1 billion-$2.4 billion due to strong vinyl and caustic pricing. Both products were favorably affected by reduced runs in Europe and Asia. Midstream guidance was also increased due to higher margins from gas processing and sulfur prices at the Al Hosn project, but segment profitability remains constrained by a narrow Midland to Houston crude differential. Strong FCF generation should remain in place in the near term and beyond despite higher 2022 capex and a reinstituted dividend, although risks around demand destruction remain a consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Metrics Improving: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s LTM debt/EBITDA leverage metrics continued to improve. As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>, for the LTM period ending March 31, 2022, leverage improved to 1.8x versus 2.4x in 2021 and 5.6x in 2020. FFO interest coverage improved to 6.1x versus 5.3x in 2021 and 3.3x in 2020. While current metrics are robust, they reflect above-cycle oil & gas prices. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s overall debt and interest remain elevated vs. peers, but is improving given cumulative debt reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Maturity Wall Manageable: Following refinancings and debt repayments, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s near-term wall is moderate. As calculated by <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> on a pro forma basis for the most recent debt tender, maturities due over the next few years (excluding puttable 2036 bonds) include nothing due in 2022, $362 million in 2023, and $1.42 billion in 2024. The combination of cash balances, full availability on the company's unsecured revolver, and strong projected FCF should comfortably address the near-term maturity schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> enjoys modest but meaningful diversification through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in basic chemicals in North America, and its midstream segment. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given limited reinvestment and are enjoying significant tailwinds due to strong domestic demand and feedstock cost advantages, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has sharply elevated energy prices in Europe and resulted in production cuts and tighter supply for PVC and caustic soda product chains. The midstream segment has historically been weighed down by weak Permian-Houston differentials, but these should widen gradually in line with increasing Permian production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Carbon Reduction Initiatives: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s commitment to scope 3 emissions stands out versus U.S. E&P peers, and includes a medium-term (2032) and long-term (2050) component. To this end, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is further commercializing its existing Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) business to create a carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) platform using its geologic formations. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is constructing the world's largest direct air capture plant of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually, with commercial operation expected in late 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Management views low carbon ventures as a growth engine that could eventually rival chemicals in earnings; however, a number of regulatory uncertainties still surround the business given its early stage development, including section 45Q tax credits. <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> anticipates the company will maximize the use of third-party capital and credits in funding the growth of this platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Equity Credit: For purposes of calculating leverage, <span class="companylink">Fitch</span> currently assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under <span class="companylink">Fitch</span>'s "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s credit profile is mixed. The rating is dominated by relatively high debt and interest costs associated with the Anadarko acquisition, which was completed just prior to a major downturn in oil prices. However, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is aggressively repaying debt, and refinancing risk is modest, given recent debt repayments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Outside of its debt and interest burden, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has several long-term characteristics of an investment grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at 1,074kboepd in production from continuing operations in 1Q22, it is among the largest independents, smaller than <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (1,540kboepd) but significantly larger than E&Ps such as <span class="companylink">Ovintiv Corporation</span> (500kboepd), <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (575kboepd), <span class="companylink">Apache Corporation</span> (404kboepd), and Hess (297kboepd). <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s liquids weighting is above average. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s cash netbacks are in line with the above listed peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Upstream diversification is above-average, with E&P operations split between the U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is the number one producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and a large Permian producer, with one of the biggest net acreage positions (2.9 million acres, split roughly between Permian unconventional shale, and EOR). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which also sets it apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $95/barrel in 2022, $76/barrel in 2023, $57/barrel in 2024, and $50/barrel in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $4.25/mcf in 2022, $3.25/mcf in 2023, $2.75/mcf in 2024, and $2.50/mcf in 2025;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No incremental asset sales assumed beyond those announced YTD;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Majority of FCF dedicated to debt repayment over the life of the forecast but matched with rising shareholder distributions beginning in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex of $4.3 billion in 2022, declining to just under $4.2 billion by the end of the forecast in line with a declining oil prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Production volumes of 1.15 million boepd in 2022 rising to 1.2 million boepd by the end of the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage approaching 2.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 5.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Incremental debt reduction resulting in company reported debt meaningfully below $20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage approaching 3.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 4.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Change in financial policy that derails future de-leveraging efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash on hand as of March 31, 2022 was $1.91 billion, excluding restricted cash of $42 million, and there was no draw on the company's committed $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolver due June 30, 2025, for core liquidity of approximately $5.9 billion. The only financial covenant associated with the revolver was a max debt/capitalization ratio of 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Separately, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> had full availability on a $400 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination and matures December 2024. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s maturity wall is manageable given the impact of recent debt repayments focusing on 2022-2026 maturities, as well as good liquidity and strong projected FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a large, diversified E&P with core upstream operations in the U.S. (Permian, DJ, Gulf of Mexico, Powder River Basin), and the MENA region (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and Midstream and Marketing.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-16 December 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (<span class="companylink">OXY</span>) to 'BB+' from 'BB' and upgraded <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s senior unsecured notes and revolver to 'BB+'/'RR4' from 'BB'/'RR4'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable from Positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The main driver for the upgrade is the progress made YTD reducing debt, including the recently completed debt tender. Pro forma for the tender, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> reduced its balance sheet debt by $6.4 billion in 2021, and Fitch believes additional debt reductions are likely in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s ratings reflect its large size, liquids-weighted profile, and robust asset base including an anchor position in the Permian with over 2.9 million net acres. The ratings also reflect incremental debt reduction to date, a manageable maturity wall and above-average diversification vs. independent upstream peers, including the chemicals and midstream businesses. Rating concerns include elevated LTM debt leverage metrics and high interest costs associated with the Anadarko acquisition, including $800 million in run-rate preferred dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Tender Progresses Debt Repayment: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> accelerated deleveraging in Q4 through a multi-tranche any-and-all debt tender for up to $2.0 billion across 14 debt tranches. The tender followed cumulative debt reductions of around $4.5 billion up to Q321. While the $1.54 billion tendered was somewhat below the $2.0 billion tender offer limit, Fitch believes the company has strong line of sight on additional, economical debt reductions in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong FCF Generation: As calculated by Fitch, after FCF generation of just $120 million in Q1, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s FCF jumped sharply higher to $2.4 billion in Q2 and $2.3 billion in Q3. Higher cash flow from operations was driven by stronger oil prices, robust performance in non-oil segments, and a partial reversal of a cargo related working capital draw. The company raised its OxyChem guidance 80% due to tighter market conditions for PVC and caustic soda. Midstream guidance is also higher due to better sulfur prices at the Al Hosn project, despite compressed Midland-Gulf coast crude spreads. Strong FCF generation should remain in place in the near term given low maintenance capex of levels of $2.9 billion and a slashed common dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Modest Asset Sales: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> announced asset sales of approximately $2.0 billion since 4Q20, including non-operated Denver-Julesburg basin properties ($285 million), <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Partners</span> units ($200 million), non-core Permian acreage ($508 million), and Ghana ($750 million pre-adjustment), which meets the lower end of the company's most recent $2 billion-$3 billion asset sale target. For modelling purposes Fitch assumed no incremental asset sales beyond those achieved to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Metrics Elevated but Improving: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s LTM debt/EBITDA leverage metrics continued to improve as pandemic quarters roll off and incremental debt repayment takes hold. As calculated by Fitch, at Sept. 30, 2021, leverage improved to 3.3x, vs. 6.3x in Q121. Total interest burden has moderated in line with recent debt repayments but remains elevated versus peers given still-high overall debt levels and interest/preferred expense. As calculated by Fitch, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s LTM FFO interest coverage at 3Q21 was 4.8x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Maturity Wall Manageable: Following refinancings and 2021 debt repayments, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s near-term wall is moderate. As calculated by Fitch on a pro forma basis for the most recent debt tender, maturities due over the next few years (excluding puttable 2036 bonds) include $453 million in 2022, $465 million in 2023, and $1.73 billion in 2024. The combination of cash balances, full availability on the company's unsecured revolver, and strong projected FCF should comfortably address the near-term maturity schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: <span class="companylink">OXY</span> enjoys modest but meaningful diversification through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in most basic chemicals in North America, and its midstream segment. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given limited reinvestment and are enjoying significant tailwinds in 2021 due to lingering pandemic supply issues in PVC and caustic soda product chains. While Fitch expects the midstream segment to lose money given weak Permian-Houston differentials, this has been partly offset by higher sulfur prices at the Al Hosn project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Carbon Reduction Initiatives: <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s commitment to scope 3 emissions stands out versus U.S. E&P peers. <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is further commercializing its Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) business to offer permanent carbon capture/storage in its geologic formations. The company is constructing the world's largest direct air capture plant of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually, with construction beginning in 2022. Management views low carbon ventures as a growth engine that could eventually rival chemicals in earnings; however, a number of regulatory uncertainties still surround the business given its early stage development, including section 45Q tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Equity Credit: For purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch currently assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s credit profile is mixed. The rating is dominated by relatively high debt levels and interest costs associated with the Anadarko acquisition, which was completed just prior to a major downturn in oil prices. However, <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s immediate refinancing risk is modest, given recent debt repayments targeting 2022-2026 maturities and earlier bond market issuances to extend the wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Outside of the high debt and interest burden, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has several long-term characteristics of a high-grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at 1,160kboepd in production from continuing operations in 3Q21, it is among the largest independents, smaller than <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> but significantly larger than E&Ps such as <span class="companylink">Ovintiv Corporation</span> (534.6kboepd), <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (608.2kboepd), <span class="companylink">Apache Corporation</span> (389kboepd), and Hess (283.8kboepd). <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s liquids weighting is above average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Upstream diversification is also above-average, with E&P operations split between the U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is the number one producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and a large Permian producer, with one of the biggest net acreage positions (2.9 million acres, split roughly between Permian unconventional shale, and EOR). <span class="companylink">OXY</span> has additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which also sets it apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $67/barrel for 2022, $57/barrel for 2023 and $50/barrel for 2024 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Henry Hub natural gas prices of $3.25/mcf for 2022, $2.75/mcf for 2023, and $2.50/mcf for 2024 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- No incremental asset sales assumed beyond those announced YTD;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Majority of FCF dedicated to debt repayment over the life of the forecast but matched with rising shareholder distributions beginning in 2022;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Capex of $2.9 billion in 2021, rising to $3.8 billion by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Production volumes of 1.16 million boepd in 2021 rising to 1.24 million boepd by 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage approaching 2.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle FFO leverage approaching 3.1x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Incremental debt reduction, with company reported debt approaching $20 billion;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle FFO interest coverage approaching 5.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Impairments to liquidity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage approaching 3.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle FFO leverage approaching 3.6x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash on hand as of Sept. 30, 2021 (prior to tendering activity) was $2.06 billion, excluding restricted case of $220 million, and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver, for core liquidity of just under $7.1 billion. In December <span class="companylink">OXY</span> extended its unsecured credit facility by 2.5 years to June 30, 2025 but changed several terms, including lowering the total commitment from $5.0 billion to $4.0 billion, replacing Libor with Term SOFR, and adding an environmental Key Performance Indicator related to the company's scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. The only associated financial covenant remains the max debt/capitalization ratio of 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Separately, <span class="companylink">OXY</span> had full availability on a $400 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination and matures November 2022. <span class="companylink">OXY</span>'s maturity wall is manageable given the impact of recent debt repayments focusing on 2022-2026 maturities, as well as good liquidity and strong projected FCF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">OXY</span> is a large, diversified E&P with core upstream operations in the U.S. (Permian, DJ, Gulf of Mexico, Powder River Basin), and the MENA region (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and Midstream and Marketing.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-16 December 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Operating, LP</span>'s (Western) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB+' from 'BB' and senior unsecured notes to 'BB+'/'RR4' from 'BB'/'RR4'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Stable from Positive. The upgrade is primarily driven by the upgrade of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (BB+/Stable). Occidental is Western's largest counterparty and is expected to contribute approximately 60% of Western's 2021 revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western has relatively low capital expenditure requirements and manageable debt maturities over the next two years. The company is generating strong cash flows based on improving cost position, and stable volumes, in a largely improved commodity price environment. Western's ratings also reflect Fitch's expectation that leverage will be around 3.8x or lower through 2022. Western's management is committed to leverage metrics of below 4.0x in 2021 and at or below 3.5x by YE 2022, using excess cash flow to reduce debt if required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Counterparty Exposure: Occidental is Western's largest counterparty, and consequently, Western is still predominately exposed to non-investment-grade counterparties as a gathering and processing company. Occidental is expected to contribute approximately two-thirds of Western's revenues in 2021 and over the near term after that. Occidental's operational and financial strength influence Western's credit profile, because Western depends on Occidental for future growth. Fitch believes Western's midstream operations will remain strategically important to Occidental's production, particularly in the Permian Basin, despite uncertainties in near-term growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Throughput Volumes to Remain Flat: Lower levels of capital expenditures and exploration and production (E&P) activities, particularly from Occidental, could prompt a slight EBITDA decline in 2021 from 2020 levels. 1Q21 volumes trended down in the Delaware Basin, but were back up in 2Q21. In 2021, Western is expected to generate 40% of EBITDA from the Delaware Basin, 36% of EBTIDA in the DJ Basin, about 12% from other noncore regions and 12% from equity investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western's leverage (as measured by total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA) was 3.9x at YE 2020, and with the recent announcement of the tender offer, Fitch expects it could decline to below 3.8x by YE 2021. Western will likely continue to use a portion of excess cash flow to reduce leverage and management-forecast leverage declining below 3.5x by 2022 is possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset and Contract Profile: Fitch believes Western will generate over 90% of its gross margin from fee-based and fixed-price contracts in 2021. Western has limited direct commodity price exposure. It is also diversified geographically, supported by a blend of contracts with minimum volume commitment (MVCs) and/or cost of service (COS) components, relative to the more standard requirements contracts prevalent in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Approximately 79% of Western's natural gas throughput volume was protected by either MVCs or COS components in fiscal 2020, and approximately 85% of its crude oil and natural gas liquids and 100% of produced-water throughput were also supported by either MVCs or COS components. However, if any of the contracts' rates, whether in dollars per actual volume or dollars per contracted volume, are high relative to the market, there is a strong likelihood for Western's E&P customers to consider renegotiating the long-term contracts, especially those customers compelled to seek the shelter of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Short-Term Contracts: Fitch's rating case assumes the economic value of the contracts between Occidental and Western remains intact, with no renegotiation of contract terms deemed materially unfavorable to Western. Western's long-term weighted average contract life is 7-11 years (other than the life-of-lease contracts) collectively for its gas, crude oil and water businesses at YE 2020. Western also has a portfolio of equity investments, including ownership interests in long-haul pipelines in the Permian, which should maintain stable cash flow in the near term. Fitch believes the Permian will remain Western's cornerstone of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ownership Uncertainties: Future ownership uncertainties remain an overhanging issue for Western, as Occidental continues to reduce its ownership stake in Western's publicly traded parent, <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Partners, LP</span> (WES), now standing at less than 50% limited partner interest. Since 4Q20, Occidental has sold about $250 million worth of WES units, of which about $50 million worth of units were recently purchased by WES. Occidental continues to own the 2.2% general partner interest in WES.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The operational alignment between Occidental and Western in the Permian remains intact in the long term, given the good fit between legacy <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum Corporation</span>'s (rating withdrawn) and Western's assets in the basin. However, Occidental reeling back legacy Anadarko's historic focus on the DJ Basin may materially impede Western's future growth. Western targets company growth through third-party volumes, but Fitch believes such growth will be much slower as upstream customers become increasingly capital disciplined regarding production spending under the volatile commodities price environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent-Subsidiary Linkage: Fitch analyzed the parent-subsidiary relationship between Western and Occidental, and determined that their respective IDRs are the same based on the companies' standalone credit profiles (SCP). Occidental is Western's largest counterparty (60% of expected revenues for YE 2021) and accounts for most of its growth. However, Western does not rely on funding from Occidental and maintains a separate board of directors and management team. If the SCP of the two entities were to diverge, their IDR would also be separate, reflecting strong operational ties, but offset by declining ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western primarily operates in the Delaware Basin and DJ Basin and expects to derive about 60% of its 2021 revenue from Occidental. <span class="companylink">EQM Midstream Partners, LP</span> (BB/Negative) is one of Western's peers that operates primarily in the Appalachian Basin and has material, concentrated counterparty exposure to <span class="companylink">EQT Corporation</span> (BB+/Stable). <span class="companylink">DCP Midstream, LP</span> (BB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">EnLink Midstream, LLC</span> (BB+/Stable) operate in multiple basins and are more diverse than Western.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western derives over 90% of its margins from fixed-fee contracts, largely with MVC or COS provisions. DCP has higher volume risk, with only about 70% of its gross margins generated from fee-based contracts, compared with 90% of EnLink's gross margins. EQM had approximately 65% of revenues from firm reservation fees for the YE Dec. 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In terms of EBITDA, Western is expected to generate about $1.9 billion in 2021, which is larger than EQM, DCP and EnLink. However, each of the peers is sizable, generating over $1 billion in EBITDA annually. Western exhibits lower leverage than all three of its peers, with 3.9x at YE 2020, and around 3.8x expected leverage YE 2021. Fitch expects leverage of approximately 5.1x for EnLink, and around 4.4x for DCP and 5.4x-5.6x for EQM for YE 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within the Agency's Rating Case for the Issuer:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base case West Texas Intermediate oil price of $68/barrel for 2021, $67/barrel for 2022, and $50/barrel for 2023 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $3.80/thousand cubic feet (mcf) for 2021, and $3.25/mcf for 2022 and $2.75/mcf for 2023 beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Declining throughput volume and operating performance in segments outside the Permian through 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Distribution increase as per management's forecast: 5% above 2020 distributions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No adverse changes in existing contract terms between Western and its major counterparties that would materially impair Western's expected cash flow;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No significant change in the financial policy due to potential ownership changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Favorable rating action at Occidental may lead to positive rating action for Western, provided the factors driving a rating change at Occidental have benefits that accrue to the credit profile of Western;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) at or below 4.0x and a distribution coverage ratio above 1.1x on a sustained basis, with gross margin remaining above 90% fee based or fixed priced;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Asset and business line expansion leading to a more diversified cash flow profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Counterparty quality and strategic position remains stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Leverage at or above 5.0x and a distribution coverage ratio below 1.1x on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative rating action at Occidental;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Decline in counterparty quality or strategic position;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Materially unfavorable changes in contract mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative changes in law -- either new laws or rulings on old laws -- that cause volumetric declines and push profitability lower and leverage higher on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adoption of a growth-funding strategy that does not include a significant equity component, inclusive of retained earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: Western had approximately $99.8 million in cash, $220 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolver and $5.1 million in outstanding LOC at Sept. 30, 2021, resulting in approximately $1.775 billion available on its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF). Fitch expects liquidity will remain adequate over the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western paid off its $431 million in debt due in 1Q21. There is no additional maturity in the remainder of 2021. With the completion of the tender offer, Western now has an upcoming maturity of $502 million due in 2022 and $213 million due in 2023. With ample availability on its revolver and strong cash flows, Western has sufficient liquidity to pay off its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In December 2019, Western extended the RCF's maturity date to February 2025 from February 2024. The credit facility requires Western to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio at or below 5.0x, or a consolidated leverage ratio of 5.5x for quarters ending in the 270-day period immediately following certain acquisitions. Western is in compliance with this covenant, and Fitch expects it will remain so for the balance of the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western also accessed capital markets in January 2020, issuing $3.2 billion fixed-rate senior notes across three tranches, which come due in 2025, 2030 and 2050, as well as $300 million of floating-rate notes due 2023. The net proceeds from the senior notes and floating-rate notes were used to repay the $3.0 billion outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility and RCF, and to fund general corporate expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Western is a subsidiary of WES, which, in turn, is a publicly traded is a master limited partnership (MLP), the general partner of which is owned by <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. Western owns, operates, acquires and develops midstream energy assets generating its cash flow primarily from Delaware Basin within the Permian and the DJ Basin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Operating, LP</span> has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Group Structure due to as the company operates under a somewhat complex group structure of master limited partnership, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the ratings in conjunction with other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-Frankfurt am Main-28 October 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned <span class="companylink">Kosmos Energy Ltd</span>.'s newly issued USD400 million notes a final senior unsecured rating of 'B'. The Recovery Rating is 'RR4'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Kosmos's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B' and senior unsecured rating of 'B' are on Rating Watch Positive (RWP). The RWP follows the announced acquisition of additional interests in Kosmos's existing assets in Ghana from <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b></span>. We view the transaction as significantly credit-enhancing, due to its low-risk, immediate contribution to cash flows and production, as well as given the significant amount of equity being used to fund the acquisition. Following the transaction, we expect Kosmos to be able to internally fund committed capex related to its Tortue LNG project, and to reduce its funds from operations (FFO) net leverage to below 3.0x by 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Resolution of the RWP is contingent on the successful finalisation of all outstanding aspects of the transaction, including the expiration of the pre-emption period, at which point Fitch may upgrade the IDR and senior unsecured ratings by one notch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ghanaian Assets Acquisition Credit-Positive: The acquisition of additional stakes in the Ghanaian assets for approximately USD550 million (USD460 million net of purchase-price adjustments) provides Kosmos with an immediate stream of cash flows, contributing around 17 kboepd of incremental pro-forma net volumes from assets adjacent to its existing Ghana acreage. The assets' cash flow contribution, alongside USD142 million of equity financing used for the acquisition, will support deleveraging in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pre-Emption Rights Neutral: Currently, <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b></span>'s partners in the Ghanaian assets have pre-emption rights on a portion of the acquired assets, whereby they may elect to pre-emptively purchase certain portions of the assets under the same conditions as agreed by Kosmos within 30 days of the transaction announcement. While the exercise of these rights by one or more partners is not our base case, we do not expect this to have a meaningful rating impact, as the resultant somewhat smaller run-rate production and reserve profile would be offset by a lower ultimate acquisition price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Progress on Funding Transactions: Kosmos has successfully executed the sale and leaseback of its Mauritania & Senegal floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) asset, which is expected to yield total cash preservation of over USD300 million through 2023. In addition, it has made substantial progress on additional funding transactions that have been largely de-risked following a recovery in hydrocarbon pricing during 2021. We now expect Kosmos to self-fund its remaining capex in the Tortue LNG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Liquidity: Kosmos successfully extended the maturity of its reserve-based loan (RBL) in May 2021, leaving no material debt maturities until 2024. The recovery in hydrocarbon pricing, combined with management of its cost base, has also alleviated pressure on covenant compliance, which we previously identified as a potential liquidity constraint. These factors, alongside committed liquidity of around USD785 million, provide for a comfortable liquidity position that is commensurate with the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deleveraging Accelerated: We expect Kosmos to reduce its FFO net leverage to below 3.0x by 2023 under our rating-case assumptions. The improved leverage expectations are predicated on immediate cash flow accretion from the newly acquired stakes in the Ghanaian assets, alongside successful execution of the FPSO sale and leaseback transaction and other liquidity-enhancing transactions, to fund near-term cash burn as Mauritania & Senegal capex peaks in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We rate Kosmos in line with <span class="companylink">Ithaca Energy Ltd</span> (B/Stable). The latter benefits from lower capital intensity, lower net leverage of comfortably below 2x, and stronger cash flow generation resulting from more robust hedging. However, these strengths are offset by Kosmos's significantly higher proved reserve life of more than seven years (five years for Ithaca), higher production volumes (pro-forma Ghanaian asset acquisition), lower production costs as well as a more liquids-focused production mix, leading to higher long-term margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc</span> (B-/Positive), Kosmos has a smaller reserve base, lower reserve life of 24 years on a 2P basis (<span class="companylink">Seplat</span>: 30 years on a 2P basis), and higher leverage, which is offset by a more diversified asset base versus <span class="companylink">Seplat</span>'s high exposure to areas characterised by geopolitical risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Brent crude price of USD63/bbl in 2021, USD55/bbl in 2022 and USD53/bbl thereafter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Henry Hub price of USD3.4/mcf in 2021, USD2.75/mcf in 2022, and USD2.45/mcf thereafter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total net production of around 57kboepd in 2021, increasing to more than 95kboepd in 2024 from the ramp-up of production from the Ghanaian assets and production commencement in Mauritania/Senegal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Tortue Ahmeyim project funded by the sale and leaseback of the FPSO unit, National Oil Company financing and additional debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Capex as guided by the company</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- No dividend payments until 2023</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions for Recovery Analysis:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Our recovery analysis assumes that Kosmos would be reorganised as a going-concern in bankruptcy rather than liquidated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganisation EBITDA level upon which we base the enterprise valuation (EV)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Kosmos's going-concern EBITDA reflects our view on EBITDA generation from the company's Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets and Ghanaian assets, assuming a sustained period of USD30/bbl Brent prices. This is followed by one year of moderate recovery, yielding a going-concern EBITDA of USD225 million. We focus our analysis on EBITDA attributable to the GoM assets and Ghanaian assets as the subsidiaries owning these assets guarantee the senior unsecured notes. We increased our going-concern EBITDA to account for the increased cash flow generation from the Ghanaian assets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- A 4.5x multiple is used to calculate a post-reorganisation EV, reflecting Kosmos's small size relative to peers', average asset quality, and good growth prospects</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The senior unsecured notes rank pari passu with Kosmos's USD400 million revolver, but are subordinated to the company's USD200 million GoM term loan that is secured against the GoM assets. The notes are also subordinated to the company's USD1.24 billion RBL with respect to the legacy Ghanaian and Equatorial Guinea assets. The new and existing notes and revolver benefit from joint and several senior unsecured guarantees from restricted subsidiaries owning the assets in the GoM and the newly acquired Ghanaian assets. They are guaranteed on a subordinated unsecured basis by the restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the RBL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- After deducting 10% for administrative claims, our analysis resulted in a waterfall-generated recovery computation (WGRC) in the 'RR4' band, indicating a 'B' rating for the new and existing bonds. The WGRC output percentage on current metrics and assumptions was 37%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Successful completion of the acquisition of the Ghanaian assets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-FFO net leverage trending towards 3.0x</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The ratings are on RWP, therefore making a negative rating action unlikely at least in the short term. However, failure to successfully finalise the transaction related to the Ghanaian assets or integrate these assets would lead to removal of the RWP, rating affirmation and the assignment of a Stable Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Failure to maintain FFO net leverage at below 4.0x on a sustained basis would be rating-negative</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Excluding the increased stakes in the Ghanaian assets, a lowering of the RBL's borrowing base that cannot be covered by internal liquidity sources</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Liquidity: At end-June 2021, Kosmos had around USD150 million of cash as well as USD635 million available under its USD400 million revolving credit facility, which matures in May 2022 and a USD1.24 billion RBL that matures in March 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At end-June 2021, indebtedness stood at around USD2.3 billion, comprising USD1 billion drawn under the RBL (after the last bi-annual re-determination, the borrowing base was in excess of USD1.25 billion), which starts amortising in March 2024; USD1,100 million of senior notes due in April 2026; and USD200 million of the GoM term loan due in 2025 (starts amortising in 4Q21).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The new USD400 million senior unsecured notes are being used to facilitate part of the USD550 million Ghanaian asset acquisition in addition to the equity financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Kosmos is a full-cycle deep-water independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Its production assets include producing fields (primarily oil) offshore in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and in the deep-water US GoM. Its development projects include the Greater Tortue gas field (26.7% interest) offshore in Mauritania and Senegal.</p>

We view the transaction as significantly credit-enhancing, due to its low-risk, immediate contribution to cash flows and production, as well as given the significant amount of equity being used to fund the acquisition. Following the transaction, we expect Kosmos to be able to internally fund committed capex related to its Tortue LNG project, and to deleverage below 3.0x by 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Resolution of the RWP is contingent on the successful finalisation of all outstanding aspects of the transaction, including the contemplated bond issuance and expiration of the pre-emption period, at which point Fitch may upgrade the IDR and senior unsecured ratings by one notch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Kosmos's new senior unsecured notes will benefit from a senior guarantee from the acquired assets, which are not encumbered by any secured debt. The added cash flow coverage from these assets has led us to upgrade Kosmos's existing senior unsecured notes and change their Recovery Rating to 'RR4' from 'RR5'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The assignment of the final rating is contingent on the receipt of final documentation with terms and conditions conforming to documentation already received.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ghanaian Assets Acquisition Credit-Positive: The acquisition of additional stakes in the Ghanaian assets for approximately USD550 million (USD460 million net of purchase-price adjustments) provides Kosmos with an immediate stream of cash flows, contributing around 17 kboepd of incremental pro-forma net volumes from assets adjacent to its existing Ghana acreage. The assets' cash flow contribution, alongside USD125 million of equity financing used for the acquisition, will support deleveraging in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Pre-Emption Rights Neutral: Currently, <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b></span>'s partners in the Ghanaian assets have pre-emption rights on a portion of the acquired assets, whereby they may elect to pre-emptively purchase certain portions of the assets under the same conditions as agreed by Kosmos within 30 days of the transaction announcement. While the exercise of these rights by one or more partners is not our base case, we do not expect this to have a meaningful rating impact, as the resultant somewhat smaller run-rate production and reserve profile would be offset by a lower ultimate acquisition price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Progress on Funding Transactions: Kosmos has successfully executed the sale and leaseback of its Mauritania & Senegal floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) asset, which is expected to yield total cash preservation of over USD300 million through 2023. In addition, it has made substantial progress on additional funding transactions that have been largely de-risked following a recovery in hydrocarbon pricing during 2021. We now expect Kosmos to self-fund its remaining capex in the Tortue LNG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Liquidity: Kosmos successfully extended the maturity of its reserve-based loan (RBL) in May 2021, leaving no material debt maturities until 2024. The recovery in hydrocarbon pricing, combined with management of its cost base, has also alleviated pressure on covenant compliance, which we previously identified as a potential liquidity constraint. These factors, alongside committed liquidity of around USD785 million, provide for a comfortable liquidity position that is commensurate with the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deleveraging Accelerated: We expect Kosmos to reduce its funds from operations (FFO) net leverage to below 3.0x by 2023 under our rating-case assumptions. The improved leverage expectations are predicated on immediate cash flow accretion from the newly acquired stakes in the Ghanaian assets, alongside successful execution of the FPSO sale and leaseback transaction and other liquidity-enhancing transactions, to fund near-term cash burn as Mauritania & Senegal capex peaks in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >We rate Kosmos in line with <span class="companylink">Ithaca Energy Ltd</span> (B/Stable). The latter benefits from lower capital intensity, lower net leverage of comfortably below 2x, and stronger cash flow generation resulting from more robust hedging. However, these strengths are offset by Kosmos's significantly higher proved reserve life of more than seven years (five years for Ithaca), higher production volumes (pro-forma Ghanaian asset acquisition), lower production costs as well as a more liquids-focused production mix, leading to higher long-term margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Compared with <span class="companylink">Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc</span> (B-/Positive), Kosmos has a smaller reserve base, lower reserve life of 24 years on a 2P basis (<span class="companylink">Seplat</span>: 30 years on a 2P basis), and higher leverage, which is offset by a more diversified asset base versus <span class="companylink">Seplat</span>'s high exposure to areas characterised by geopolitical risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Brent crude price of USD63/bbl in 2021, USD55/bbl in 2022 and USD53/bbl thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Henry Hub price of USD3.4/mcf in 2021, USD2.75/mcf in 2022, and USD2.45/mcf thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Total net production of around 57kboepd in 2021, increasing to more than 95kboepd in 2024 from the ramp-up of production from the Ghanaian assets and production commencement in Mauritania/Senegal;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Tortue Ahmeyim project funded by the sale and leaseback of the FPSO unit, National Oil Company financing and additional debt;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Capex as guided by the company; and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- No dividend payments until 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions for Recovery Analysis:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Our recovery analysis assumes that Kosmos would be reorganised as a going-concern in bankruptcy rather than liquidated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganisation EBITDA level upon which we base the enterprise valuation (EV).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Kosmos's going-concern EBITDA reflects our view on EBITDA generation from the company's Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets and Ghanaian assets, assuming a sustained period of USD30/bbl Brent prices. This is followed by one year of moderate recovery, yielding a going-concern EBITDA of USD225 million. We focus our analysis on EBITDA attributable to the GoM assets and Ghanaian assets as the subsidiaries owning these assets guarantee the senior unsecured notes. We increased our going-concern EBITDA to account for the increased cash flow generation from the Ghanaian assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- A 4.5x multiple is used to calculate a post-reorganisation EV, reflecting Kosmos's relatively small size relative to peers', average asset quality, and good growth prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The proposed and existing senior unsecured notes rank pari passu with Kosmos's USD400 million revolver, but are subordinated to the company's USD200 million GoM term loan that is secured against the GoM assets. The notes are also subordinated to the company's USD1.24 billion RBL with respect to the legacy Ghanaian and Equatorial Guinea assets. The proposed and existing notes and revolver benefit from joint and several senior unsecured guarantees from restricted subsidiaries owning the assets in the GoM and the newly acquired Ghanaian assets. They are guaranteed on a subordinated unsecured basis by the restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the RBL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- After deducting 10% for administrative claims, our waterfall analysis generated a a waterfall generated recovery computation (WGRC) in the 'RR4' band, indicating a 'B' rating for existing bonds and an expected 'B(EXP)' rating for proposed bonds. The WGRC output percentage on current metrics and assumptions was 37%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Successful completion of the acquisition of the Ghanaian assets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-FFO net leverage trending towards 3.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- The ratings are on RWP, therefore, a negative rating action is unlikely at least in the short term. However, failure to successfully finalise the transaction related to the Ghanaian assets or integrate these assets would lead to removal of RWP and Outlook stabilisation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Failure to maintain FFO net leverage at below 4.0x on a sustained basis would be rating-negative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Excluding the increased stakes in the Ghanaian assets, a lowering of the RBL's borrowing base that cannot be covered by internal liquidity sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improved Liquidity: At end-June 2021, Kosmos had around USD150 million of cash as well as USD635 million available under its USD400 million revolving credit facility, which matures in May 2022 and a USD1.24 billion RBL that matures in March 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At end-June 2021, indebtedness stood at around USD2.3 billion, including USD1 billion drawn under the RBL (after the fall re-determination, the borrowing base was in excess of USD1.25 billion), which starts amortising in March 2024; USD1,100 million of senior notes due in April 2026; and USD200 million of the GoM term loan due in 2025 (starts amortising in 4Q21).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The new USD400 million senior unsecured notes will be used to facilitate part of the USD550 million Ghanaian asset acquisition. In addition to the equity financing, which has already been priced, the company has a bridge facility in place for the acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Kosmos is a full-cycle deep-water independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Its production assets include producing fields (primarily oil) offshore in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and in the deep-water US GoM. Its development projects include the Greater Tortue gas field (26.7% interest) offshore in Mauritania and Senegal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-06 October 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (OXY) at 'BB', and senior unsecured notes and revolver at 'BB'/'RR4'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Positive from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The main driver for the Positive Outlook is the company's accelerated debt reduction of approximately $4.5 billion year to date, most of which was completed in the third quarter, as well as strong FCF prospects, which should provide funding for additional de-leveraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY's ratings reflect the company's large size, liquids-weighted profile, and robust asset base, including its anchor position in the Permian with over 2.9 million net acres. The ratings also reflect scope for significant incremental debt reduction, a manageable maturity wall, and above-average diversification vs independent peers from international exploration and production (E&P) in MENA, as well as chemicals and midstream businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating concerns center on still-elevated LTM debt leverage metrics, high interest costs associated with the Anadarko acquisition, including $800 million associated with the preferreds; and execution risk on remaining international asset sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Significant Debt Repayment: OXY accelerated deleveraging in Q3 with the completion of a multi-tranche $3.1 billion tender in July (upsized from $2.5 billion), the repayment of $224 million in 2.6% notes in August, and $1.052 billion in floating rate 2022 notes in September. Separately the company retired $750 million in fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. As a result of these actions, as well as earlier reductions in Q1, gross debt has been reduced by approximately $4.5 billion YTD (13% of OXY's reported debt at YE 2020), and interest expense around $170 million. Given strong projected FCF for the remainder of the year, we anticipate the company is likely to make additional debt retirements in Q421.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Strong FCF Generation: After FCF generation of just $120 million in Q1, OXY's FCF jumped sharply higher to $2.4 billion in Q2. Higher cash flow from operations was driven by stronger oil prices, robust performance in OXY's non-oil segments, and a partial reversal of a Q1 cargo related working capital draw. The company raised its OxyChem guidance 60% due to tighter market conditions for PVC and caustic soda. Midstream guidance is also higher due to better sulfur prices at the Al Hosn project, despite compressed Midland-Gulf coast crude spreads. Strong FCF generation should remain in place in the near term given low maintenance capex of levels of $2.9 billion and a slashed common dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Modest Asset Sales: OXY announced $1.3 billion in asset sales since 4Q20, including non-operated Denver-Julesburg basin properties ($285 million), <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Partners</span> units ($200 million), non-core Permian acreage ($508 million), and other non-core acreage ($350 million), versus a $2 billion-$3 billion asset sale target. Despite rising oil prices, Fitch believes execution risk around international assets like Ghana is higher, given repositioning by European supermajors toward renewables, and reluctance by management to fire sale assets. For modelling purposes Fitch assumed no incremental asset sales beyond those achieved to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Elevated But Improving Metrics: OXY's LTM debt/EBITDA leverage metrics remained elevated at 4.6x as of 2Q21, but should continue to improve as pandemic quarters roll off and incremental debt repayment takes hold. Total interest burden also remains high versus peers given high debt levels and $800 million in interest from the preferreds. As calculated by Fitch, OXY's LTM FFO interest coverage at 2Q21 was 4.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Maturity Wall Manageable: Following earlier refinancings and 2021 debt repayments, OXY's near term wall is moderate. As calculated by Fitch on a pro forma basis, maturities due over the next few years (excluding puttable 2036 bonds) include nothing due for the remainder of 2021, $728 million in 2022, $465 million in 2023, and $2.2 billion in 2024. The combination of cash balances, full availability on the $5.0 billion revolver, and strong projected FCF should comfortably address the remaining maturity schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: OXY enjoys modest, but meaningful diversification through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in most basic chemicals in North America, and its midstream segment. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given limited reinvestment, and are enjoying significant tailwinds in 2021 due to lingering pandemic supply issues in PVC and caustic soda product chains. While the midstream segment is expected to lose money given weak Permian-Houston differentials, this has been partly offset by higher sulfur prices at the Al Hosn project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Carbon Reduction Initiatives: OXY's commitment to scope 3 emissions stands out versus U.S. E&P peers. OXY plans to commercialize its Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) business to offer permanent carbon capture/storage in its geologic formations. OXY is constructing the world's largest direct air capture plant of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually, with construction beginning 2022. Management views low carbon ventures as a growth engine which could eventually rival chemicals in earnings; however, many uncertainties surround the business given its early stage development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Equity Credit: For purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch currently assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY's credit profile is mixed. The rating is currently dominated by relatively high debt levels and interest costs associated with the Anadarko acquisition, which was completed just prior to a major downturn in oil prices. However, immediate refinancing risk is moderate, given recent debt repayments targeting 2022-2026 maturities and earlier bond market issuances to extend the wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, OXY has several long-term characteristics of a high-grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at 1,203kboepd in production from continuing operations in 2Q21, it is among the largest independents, smaller than <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, but significantly larger than E&Ps such as <span class="companylink">Ovintiv Corporation</span> (554.5kboepd), <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (566.8kboepd), <span class="companylink">Apache Corporation</span> (395.2kboepd), and Hess (328.3kboepd). OXY's liquids weighting is above average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Upstream diversification is also above-average, with E&P operations split between the U.S. (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). OXY is the number one producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and a large Permian producer, with one of the biggest net acreage positions (2.9 million acres, split roughly between Permian unconventional shale, and EOR). OXY has additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which also sets it apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $60/barrel for the remainder of 2021, $52/barrel for 2022, and $50/barrel for 2023 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $3.40/mcf for 2021, $2.75/mcf in 2022, and $2.45/mcf for 2023 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No incremental asset sales assumed beyond those announced YTD;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess FCF largely dedicated to debt repayment over the life of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex flatlined at $2.9 billion in 2021 and 2022, and rising moderately thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Production volumes of 1.16 million boepd in 2021 rising to 1.24 million boepd by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Shareholder distributions held flat until 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Incremental debt reduction, with company reported debt approaching $28 billion;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage approaching 3.2x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO leverage approaching 3.6x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Impairments to liquidity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage approaching 3.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO leverage approaching 4.1x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unrestricted cash on hand as of June 30, 2021 (prior to debt repayments) was $4.57 billion, and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver (maturing January 2023), for core liquidity of just under $9.57 billion. Separately OXY had full availability on a $400 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination and matures November 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY's maturity wall is manageable given the impact of recent debt repayments focusing on 2022-2026 maturities, as well as good liquidity and strong projected FCF, and asset sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY is a large, diversified E&P with core upstream operations in the U.S. (Permian, DJ, Gulf of Mexico, Powder River Basin), and the MENA region (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and Midstream and Marketing.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-24 June 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed Western Midstream Operating, LP's (WES) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB' and senior unsecured notes at 'BB'/'RR4'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The affirmation is primarily driven by the rating affirmation and Stable Outlook of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (OXY; BB/Stable). OXY is WES's largest counterparty and is expected to contribute approximately two-thirds of WES's 2021 revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >WES's ratings also reflect Fitch's expectation that leverage will remain around 4.0x or lower through 2022. WES has modestly increased distributions in 2021 (by approximately 5% annually). However, WES management is committed to lowering leverage primarily using excess cashflow to reach target leverage metrics of below 4.0x in 2021 and 3.5x by YE 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Counterparty Exposure: WES's counterparty risk improved following OXY's rating upgrade in June 2020, as OXY is WES's largest counterparty. However, WES is still predominately exposed to non-investment-grade counterparties as a gathering and processing (G&P) company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >WES's significant customer concentration in OXY is expected to contribute approximately two-thirds of WES's revenues in 2021, in-line with 2020 numbers. OXY's operational and financial strength influence WES's credit profile, because WES depends on OXY for future growth. Fitch believes WES's midstream operations will remain strategically important to OXY's production, particularly in the Permian Basin, despite uncertainties in near-term growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Throughput Volumes To Remain Flat: WES's leverage (as measured by total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA) was 3.9x at YE 2020 and Fitch expects it to trend to 3.8x-4.1x in 2021, declining below 4.0x in 2022. Lower levels of capex and E&P activities, particularly from OXY, could prompt a slight EBTIDA decline in 2021. First-quarter 2021 (1Q21) volumes continue to trend down in the Delaware Basin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In 2021, WES is expected to generate 40% of EBITDA from the Delaware Basin, 37% of EBTIDA in the DJ Basin, about 11% from other noncore regions and 12% from equity investments. However, Fitch believes WES will use financial levers including further reductions in capex and distributions (that are increasing but still lower than historical levels) to deleverage through 2022, with Management forecast leverage declining below 3.5x by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset and Contract Profile: Fitch believes WES will generate over 90% of its gross margin from fee-based and fixed-price contracts in 2021. WES had limited direct commodity price exposure. It is also diversified geographically, supported by a blend of contracts with Minimum Volume Commitment (MVCs) and/or Cost of Service (COS) components, relative to the more standard requirements contracts prevalent in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Approximately 79% of WES's natural gas throughput volume was protected by either MVCs or COS components in fiscal 2020, and approximately 85% of its crude-oil and NGLs and 100% of produced-water throughput were also supported by either MVCs or COS components. However, Fitch believes that if any of the contracts' rates, whether in dollars per actual volume or dollars per contracted volume, are high relative to the market, there is a strong likelihood for WES's E&P customers to consider renegotiating the long-term contracts, especially those customers compelled to seek the shelter of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Short-Term Contracts: Fitch's rating case assumes the economic value of the contracts between OXY and WES remains intact, with no renegotiation of contract terms deemed materially unfavorable to WES. WES's long-term weighted average contract life was more than seven years collectively for its gas, crude-oil and water businesses at YE 2020. WES also has a portfolio of equity investments, including ownership interests in long-haul pipelines in the Permian, which should maintain stable cash flow in the near term. Fitch believes the Permian will remain WES's cornerstone of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Ownership Uncertainties: Future ownership uncertainties remain an overhanging issue for WES, as OXY continues to reduce its ownership stake in WES, now standing at 50.2%—48.0% limited partner interest and 2.2% general partner interest following WES's recent deconsolidation from OXY's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The operational alignment between OXY and WES in the Permian remains intact in the long term, given the good fit between legacy <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum Corporation</span>'s (WD) and WES's assets in the basin. However, OXY reeling back legacy Anadarko's historic focus on the DJ basin may materially impede WES's future growth. WES targets company growth through third-party volumes, but Fitch believes such growth will be much slower as upstream customers become increasingly capital-disciplined regarding production spending under the volatile commodities price environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Parent Subsidiary Linkage: Fitch rates WES on a standalone basis, as WES and OXY do not have a parent-subsidiary relationship. WES was deconsolidated from OXY's balance sheet in January 2020. The limited-partnership agreement was amended and significantly expanded unitholders' rights, including the right to remove and replace OXY as the general partner. WES has a separate board of directors and separate management team from OXY. WES is also reported under the equity method of accounting in OXY's financial statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >WES primarily operates in the Delaware basin and DJ basin and derives about 67% of its revenue from OXY (BB/Stable). <span class="companylink">EQM Midstream Partners, LP</span> (EQM; BB/Negative), is one of WES's peers and it operates primarily in the Appalachian basin and has material, concentrated counterparty exposure to <span class="companylink">EQT Corporation</span> (EQT; BB+/Stable). <span class="companylink">DCP Midstream, LP</span> (DCP; BB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">EnLink Midstream LLC</span> (ENLC; BB+/Stable) operate in multiple basins and are more diverse than WES.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >WES derives over 90% of its margins from fixed-fee contracts largely with MVC or COS provisions. DCP has higher volume risk with only about 70% of its gross margins being generated from fee-based contracts verses 90% of ENLC's gross margins. EQM had approximately 65% of revenues from firm reservation fees for year-ended ended Dec. 31, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In terms of EBITDA, WES is expected to generate about 1.8 billion in 2021, which is larger than EQM, DCP and ENLC. However, each of the peers is sizable, generating over $1 billion in EBITDA annually. WES exhibits lower leverage (3.9x at YE 2020, and around between 3.8x-4.1x for YE21) than all three of its peers where Fitch expects leverage at approximately 5.1x for ENLC, and around 5.0x-5.2x for DCP and 5.4x-5.6x for EQM, for YE21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case WTI oil price of $60/barrel for 2021, $52/barrel for 2022, and $50/barrel for 2023 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $2.90/mcf for 2021, and $2.45/mcf for 2022 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Declining throughput volume and operating performance in segments outside of the Permian through 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Distribution increase as per Management's forecast: 5% above 2020 distributions;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No adverse changes in existing contract terms between WES and its major counterparties that would materially impair WES's expected cash flow;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--No significant change in the financial policy due to potential ownership changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Favorable rating action at OXY may lead to positive rating action for WES, provided the factors driving a rating change at OXY have benefits that accrue to the credit profile of WES;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) at or below 4.0x and a distribution coverage ratio above 1.1x on a sustained basis, with gross margin remaining above 90% fee-based or fixed priced;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Asset and business line expansion leading to a more diversified cash flow profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Leverage as total debt-to-operating EBITDA at or above 5.0x and a distribution coverage ratio below 1.1x on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative rating action at OXY;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Materially unfavorable changes in contract mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Negative change in law, either new laws, or rulings on old laws, that cause volumetric declines and pushes profitability lower and leverage higher on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Adoption of a growth funding strategy that does not include a significant equity component, inclusive of retained earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity: WES had approximately $56 million in cash, no outstanding borrowings on the revolver and $5.1 million in outstanding LOC at March 31, 2021, resulting in approximately $1.995 billion available on its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF). Fitch expects that liquidity will remain adequate over the near term. WES paid off its $431 million in debt due in 1Q21. There is no additional maturity in the remainder of 2021. The Partnership has upcoming maturity of $581 million due in 2022. Total debt coming due in 2023 is $240 million. With close-to full availability on the $2.0 billion revolver and strong cash flows, WES has sufficient liquidity to pay-off its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In December 2019, WES extended the RCF's maturity date to February 2025 from February 2024. The credit facility requires WES to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio at or below 5.0x, or a consolidated leverage ratio of 5.5x regarding quarters ending in the 270-day period immediately following certain acquisitions. WES is currently in compliance with this covenant, and Fitch expects it will remain so for the balance of the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >WES also accessed capital markets in January 2020, issuing $3.2 billion fixed rate senior notes across three tranches, which come due in 2025, 2030 and 2050, as well as $300 million of floating rate notes due 2023. The net proceeds from the senior notes and floating rate notes were used to repay the $3.0 billion outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility and RCF and to fund general corporate expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                     <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Partners, LP</span> (WES) is a master limited partnership (MLP) owned largely by <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-22 June 2021: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (OXY) at 'BB', and senior unsecured notes and revolver at 'BB'/'RR4' with a Stable Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY's ratings reflect the company's large size, liquids-weighted profile, and robust asset base, including its anchor position in the Permian with over 2.9 million net acres. The ratings also reflect strong FCF prospects, related scope for debt reduction and above-average diversification from international exploration and production (E&P) in MENA, as well as chemicals and midstream businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Given its status as a fallen angel, rating concerns are material and center on high LTM leverage metrics and debt levels associated with the Anadarko acquisition; substantial interest costs, including $800 million associated with the preferreds; and execution risk on remaining international asset sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Improving FCF: OXY's FCF prospects have strengthened, given higher oil prices paired with low capex (around $2.9 billion), and an earlier dividend cut ($2.8 billion). In 1Q21 FCF was just $120 million, but included a large working capital draw (-$1.35 billion), linked to seasonal accruals and timing issues associated with Asian export cargoes. Fitch anticipates FCF will improve rapidly over the next few quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Scope For Debt Reduction: Given expected FCF and YTD asset sales, Fitch expects OXY will have ample cash for debt reduction, should it choose to accelerate repayment beyond near-term maturities. Given the recovery in its bond prices, Fitch expects any liability management exercises may focus on minimizing premiums paid. Since 2019, OXY repaid around $9.6 billion in debt, including $174 million in Q121.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Modest Asset Sales Traction: OXY announced $1.3 billion in asset sales since 4Q20, including non-operated Denver-​Julesburg basin properties ($285 million), <span class="companylink">Western Midstream Partners</span> units ($200 million), non-core Permian acreage ($508 million), and other non-core acreage ($350 million), versus a $2 billion-$3 billion asset sale target. Despite rising oil prices, Fitch believes execution risk around international assets like Ghana is higher, given repositioning by European supermajors toward renewables, and reluctance to fire sale assets. For modelling purposes Fitch assumed no incremental asset sales beyond those achieved to date. In total, OXY sold over $9 billion since 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Metrics Elevated: OXY's leverage metrics remained elevated, with LTM debt/EBITDA of 1Q21 of 6.3x. Fitch anticipates leverage should improve rapidly as pandemic quarters roll off and incremental debt is repaid. Interest costs also remain high versus peers given high debt levels and the $800 million in interest burden from the preferreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Maturity Wall Manageable: Following earlier refinancings, OXY's maturity wall is manageable. As calculated by Fitch, maturities over the next few years include $224 million in 2021, $2.1 billion in 2022, $949 million in 2023, and $3.9 billion in 2024. At 1Q21, the combination of $2.3 billion in cash, full availability on the $5.0 billion revolver, and strong projected FCF should comfortably address the maturity schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: OXY enjoys modest, but meaningful diversification through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in most basic chemicals in North America, and its midstream segment. Chemicals have historically contributed strong FCF given limited reinvestment needs. Industry disruptions from Winter Storm Uri and strong pandemic-linked housing demand have boosted margins for both the chlorovinyls and caustic soda derivative chains. By contrast, midstream is expected to lose money, given weak Permian-Houston differentials and excess Permian takeaway capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Carbon Reduction Initiatives: OXY's commitment to scope 3 emissions stands out versus U.S. E&P peers. OXY plans to commercialize its Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) business to offer permanent carbon capture/storage in its geologic formations. OXY is constructing the world's largest direct air capture plant of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually, with construction beginning 2022. Management views low carbon ventures as a growth engine which could eventually rival chemicals in earnings; however, many uncertainties surround the business given its early stage development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Equity Credit: For purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY's credit profile is mixed. The rating is currently dominated by relatively high gross debt levels and interest costs associated with the Anadarko acquisition, which was completed just prior to a major downturn in oil prices. Immediate refinancing risk is manageable, given the company tapped the unsecured market multiple times in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, OXY has several long-term characteristics of a high-grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at 1,117kboepd in 1Q21, it is among the largest independents, smaller than <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, but significantly larger than E&Ps such as <span class="companylink">Ovintiv Corporation</span> (538.3kboepd), <span class="companylink">Devon Energy</span> (498.8kboepd), <span class="companylink">Apache Corporation</span> (382.4kboepd), and Hess (332.8kboepd). OXY's liquids weighting is above average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Upstream diversification is also above-average, with upstream operations split between the US (Permian, DJ/Rockies, Gulf of Mexico offshore, Powder River Basin) and international in MENA (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). OXY is the number one producer in the DJ Basin, the number four producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and a large Permian producer, with one of the biggest net acreage positions (2.9 million acres, split roughly between Permian unconventional shale, and EOR). OXY has additional earnings diversification through its chemical and midstream segments, which also sets it apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages constrain the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer Include</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Base Case West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices of $60/barrel for 2021, $52/barrel for 2022, and $50/barrel for 2023 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Henry Hub natural gas prices of $2.90/mcf for 2021, and $2.45/mcf for 2022 and beyond;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- No incremental asset sales assumed beyond those achieved YTD;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Excess FCF dedicated to debt repayment over the life of the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Capex flatlined at $2.9 billion in 2021 and 2022, and rising moderately thereafter;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Production volumes of 1.16 million boepd in 2021 rising to 1.23 million boepd by 2024;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Dividends held flat and do not resume growth until 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Material gross debt reduction;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage at or below 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle FFO leverage at or below 3.7x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Impairments to liquidity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage above 3.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Mid-cycle FFO leverage above 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Unrestricted cash on hand as of March 31, 2021 was $2.27 billion, and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver (maturing January 2023), for core liquidity of just under $7.3 billion. Separately OXY had a $400 million accounts receivables securitization facility, which is subject to monthly redetermination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY's maturity wall is manageable given the combination of current liquidity, strong projected FCF, and asset sale proceeds. As calculated by Fitch, maturities over the next few years, excluding puttable zero coupon bonds, include $224 million in 2021, $2.1 billion in 2022, $949 million in 2023, and $3.9 billion in 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuer Profile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >OXY is a large, diversified E&P with core upstream operations in the U.S. (Permian, DJ, Gulf of Mexico, Powder River Basin), and the MENA region (Algeria, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar). Non-E&P segments include chemicals (OxyChem) and Midstream and Marketing.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-08 December 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BB'/'RR4' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>.'s (OXY) proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which will be used to repay outstanding debt. Concurrent with the launch, OXY expects to launch a cash tender for a number of near-term maturities, including its remaining 2021 2.6% notes, various 2022 maturities (2.6%, 2.7%, 3.125% and floating rate notes), and 2.7% 2023 notes, subject to a cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The new notes will be issued under company's existing Aug 2019 indenture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuance Helps Bridge Maturity Wall: The announced issuance, in conjunction with earlier issuances in June and August, helps bridge OXY's large maturity wall and lowers event risk around possible liability management exercises in the future. Fitch expects the combination of bond proceeds, FCF and revolver availability should be sufficient to move the company past its near-term maturities. Demonstrated market access should also create flexibility around the timing of asset sales. Should the unsecured bond market close to OXY in the future due to another sustained oil price crash, the company maintains the flexibility to issue secured or guaranteed debt under existing indentures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Limited Traction on Asset Sales: OXY continues to see modest traction on asset sales. Disposals year to date including the Greater Natural Buttes Utah asset ($69 million) Wyoming, Colorado and Utah Land Grant ($1.3 billion), and Colombia asset sales ($700 million) have largely met 2020 disposal targets. The company is targeting an additional $2 billion-$3 billion in incremental sales in 2H20/1H21. Fitch believes there is notable execution risk on incremental sales given the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic as second stage lockdowns take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Moderate De-leveraging: The pace of gross balance sheet de-leveraging has been moderate since the pandemic struck, with OXY's gross debt declining from around $47.5 billion (including $10 billion in preferreds) to around $45.7 billion on a pro forma basis following expected asset sales-linked repayments, as well as a WES unit exchange which resulted in the cancellation of a $260 million note payable to WES earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch notes that while the current refinancing activity reduces maturity wall risk, it does not address the long-term leverage issue, which remains a concern, especially if pandemic-linked demand destruction continues to weigh on oil fundamentals. Fitch will continue to review the pace of OXY's de-leveraging over time to ensure the profile is consistent with expected improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Increased Reliance on FCF: Fitch does not expect OXY will sell assets at distressed prices, and recent actions by European supermajors such as Shell and BP to reposition their portfolios toward renewables may also shrink the pool of buyers, further pressuring bids. To the degree asset sales remain challenged, Fitch would expect the company relies more heavily on FCF generation to improve its credit profile. To date, OXY has made good progress lowering its costs through operating efficiencies and synergies, somewhat offset by higher gathering and transportation costs linked to inherited Anadarko obligations. As calculated by Fitch, the company generated $594 million in positive FCF in Q320.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: OXY enjoys modest, but meaningful integration benefits through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in most basic chemicals it produces in North America, including chlorine, vinyl, PVC and caustic soda, and through its midstream segment, including gas processing plants, pipelines, CO2 infrastructure, storage, power generation and gas marketing businesses. Chemicals in particular historically contribute strong FCF given their limited reinvestment needs, which the company has been able to redeploy elsewhere. By contrast, midstream has lost money in 2020 given weak Permian-Houston differentials, which Fitch expects will continue given excess takeaway capacity out of the Permian. Diversification from non-E&P businesses has dropped on a percentage basis following the Anadarko acquisition but remains a source of differentiation from other credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Equity Credit: For purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating Derivation Versus Peers: OXY's credit profile is mixed. OXY's rating is currently dominated by its relatively high gross debt levels and related concerns about its ability to execute on de-leveraging and refinancing initiatives in a pandemic-linked environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, the company has several long-term characteristics of a high-grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at just under 1.24 million boepd (Q320), it is among the largest independents, in line with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, and is significantly larger than E&Ps such as <span class="companylink">Devon Energy Corporation</span> (BBB/RWP), <span class="companylink">Apache Corporation</span> (BB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Marathon Oil Corporation</span> (BBB-/Stable). Upstream diversification is also above-average, given OXY's number-one position in the Permian and the DJ, number-four position in the GOM, and upstream diversification in Middle Eastern countries, which remains a differentiating factor versus peers. Integration with chemicals and midstream also sets OXY apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case WTI oil price of $38/barrel for 2020, $42/barrel in 2021, $47/barrel in 2022 and $50/barrel in 2023 and the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $2.10/mcf for 2020 and $2.45/mcf across the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex of $2.5 billion in 2020, $2.9 billion in 2021, $3.3 billion in 2022 and $3.8 billion in 2023, increasing modestly in line with a rising oil price deck;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends of $1.6 billion in 2020, falling to de minimis levels in 2021, and slowly rising thereafter in line with a rising price deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained recovery in oil prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Additional progress in redeeming or refinancing the company's near-term maturity wall;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage at or below 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage at or below 3.7x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further sustained leg down in oil prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess reliance on revolver for refinancing of maturity wall, especially if done without announced asset sales;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Impairments to liquidity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage above 3.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage above 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Cash on hand at Sept. 30, 2020 was approximately $1.9 billion and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver (maturing January 2023), as well as approximately $375 million from a new A/R securitization facility, for total liquidity of just under $7.3 billion. As calculated by Fitch, the company's three-year maturity wall (excluding current refinancing activity and puttable zero coupon bonds) was approximately $7.7 billion as of Sept. 30, 2020 ($6.06 billion as of Nov. 30).</p>

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-12 August 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has assigned a 'BB'/'RR4' rating to <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>.'s (OXY) proposed issuance of 5-, 8- and 10-year senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which will be used to repay outstanding debt. Simultaneously, the company has commenced a $1.5 billion cash tender for a range of near-term maturities, including its 2021 fixed- and floating-rate notes, 2022 fixed- and floating-rate notes and 2023 2.7% notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuance Helps Bridge Maturity Wall: The announced senior unsecured notes issuance, in conjunction with an earlier $2.0 billion issuance in June, helps to bridge OXY's large maturity wall in the absence of near-term asset sales. While OXY's maturity wall remains a source of differentiated risk among peers, the current issuance lowers event risk around possible liability management exercises in the future. Fitch expects that the combination of bond proceeds, FCF and revolver availability should be sufficient to move the company past its near-term maturities. Demonstrated market access should also create flexibility around the timing of asset sales. Should the unsecured bond market close to OXY in the future due to another sustained oil price crash, the company maintains the flexibility to issue secured or guaranteed debt under existing indentures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Limited Traction on Asset Sales: OXY continues to see limited near-term traction on asset sales. To date, the company has sold around $5.6 billion, including its small position in the Greater Natural Buttes asset in Utah for $69 million in June. OXY's original asset sales targets have been upended by the coronavirus pandemic-linked downturn, although the modest rebound in oil pricing and fundamentals seen since the spring could still accelerate a portion of sales. Current guidance is for $2 billion in disposals by YE20, and the company continues to guide to meeting the lower end of its target of $10 billion in cumulative asset sales. Several of the company's assets are less correlated to oil, including the <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum Corporation</span> legacy land grant position comprising 5 million acres across Wyoming, Utah and Colorado and consisting of 1 million surface acres and the rights to 4 million subsurface acres, along with other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Maturity Wall: OXY's near-term maturity wall is high, with $4.4 billion due in 2021, $4.7 billion in 2022 and another $1.2 billion in 2023. About $479 million of maturities are due in 1Q21, less than one year away. Maturities include $992 million in 2036 zero-coupon notes (legacy Anadarko notes), as it has recently been economic for noteholders to put those notes back to the company. The put feature in the notes is annual, with the next put date October 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Prices Increase Near-Term Leverage: In response to demand reductions associated with coronavirus-related shutdowns, Fitch lowered its base case WTI oil price deck to $32/barrel in 2020 and $42/barrel in 2021, before flipping back to $50/barrel in 2022 and $52/barrel in 2023. Lower oil prices, in conjunction with lower expected asset sales and weaker midstream differentials, resulted in elevated near-term leverage for OXY. For purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Organic Measures to Defend Credit: In response to the collapse in oil prices, OXY announced the following credit defensive measures: the near-elimination of its dividend (cut to $0.01/share), which will reduce dividend payments by $2.8 billion on a run rate basis; multiple reductions in 2020 capex, including the most recent cuts to the $2.4 billion-$2.6 billion level; relief on cash payments for the company's $10 billion Berkshire preferred notes; and early achievement of increased overhead and opex synergy targets. In the near term, FCF is also helped by OXY's 2020 hedge position of approximately 350,000bpd of oil with a three-way collar, with realized prices equal to Brent plus $10 at $45 or lower. Fitch believes the company could shrink capex to enhance FCF further should it choose this route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deal Should Strengthen Long-Term Profile: To the degree the company overcomes its financing issues, Fitch believes the Anadarko acquisition will ultimately strengthen OXY's business and operational profile over the longer term, assuming a recovery in oil prices. OXY's post-acquisition size has more than doubled to just under 1.4 million boepd and, on a pro forma basis, par with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (A/Stable). Oxy is the largest producer in the Permian and DJ basins, and a top producer in the Gulf of Mexico. The ability to deploy OXY's technological, subsurface and operational expertise to Anadarko's holdings (particularly in the Permian) is expected to create significant value in a more normalized oil price environment by lowering unit costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: OXY enjoys modest, but meaningful integration benefits through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in most basic chemicals it produces in North America, including chlorine, vinyl, PVC and caustic soda, and through its midstream segment, including gas processing plants, pipelines, CO2 infrastructure, storage, power generation and gas marketing businesses. Chemicals in particular historically contribute strong FCF given their limited reinvestment needs, which the company has been able to redeploy elsewhere. Diversification from non-E&P businesses has dropped on a percentage basis following the Anadarko acquisition but remains a source of differentiation from other credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating Derivation versus Peers: OXY's credit profile is mixed. OXY's rating is currently dominated by refinancing concerns given the looming maturity wall and difficulty in meeting its maturity schedule with organic cash flows even as the market for energy assets remains hobbled by high volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, the company has several long-term characteristics of a high-grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at just under 1.4 million boepd, it is among the largest independents, in line with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, and is significantly larger than E&Ps such as <span class="companylink">Devon Energy Corporation</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Apache Corporation</span> (BB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Marathon Oil Corporation</span> (BBB/Negative). Upstream diversification is also above-average, given OXY's number-one position in the Permian and the DJ, number-four position in the GOM, and upstream diversification in Middle Eastern countries, which remains a differentiating factor versus peers. Integration with chemicals and midstream also sets OXY apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case WTI oil price of $32/barrel for the remainder of 2020, $42/barrel in 2021, $50/barrel in 2022 and $52/barrel in 2023 and the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $1.85/mcf for the remainder of 2020 and $2.45/mcf across the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex of $2.5 billion in 2020, $5.1 billion in 2021, $5.9 billion in 2022 and $6.7 billion in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--90% of 2036 zero-coupon bonds assumed put to the company in October 2020;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$300 million in asset sales in 2020 and $2.2 billion in 2021, with proceeds applied to debt paydown;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends of $1.6 billion in 2020, falling to de minimis levels in 2021, before rising in line with a rising price deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained recovery in oil prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Additional progress in redeeming or refinancing the company's near-term maturity wall;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage at or below 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage at or below 3.7x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further sustained leg down in oil prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess reliance on revolver for refinancing of maturity wall, especially if done without announced asset sales;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Impairments to liquidity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage above 3.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage above 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579[https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Tight Liquidity: Liquidity is limited in the context of low oil prices, limited asset sales and a large maturity wall. Unrestricted cash on hand at June 30, 2020 was approximately $750 million and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver (maturing January 2023) for total liquidity of $5.75 billion. The company has maturities of up to $992 million in October 2020, $4.4 billion in 2021, $4.7 billion in 2022 and an additional $1.2 billion due 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG Considerations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The highest level of environmental, social and governance (ESG) credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3. This means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, due to either their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-25 June 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (OXY) to 'BB' from 'BB-', upgraded its senior unsecured notes and revolver to 'BB'/'RR4' from 'BB-'/'RR4' and assigned a 'BB'/'RR4' rating to OXY's new senior unsecured notes. Proceeds from the notes are expected to be earmarked for repayment of near-term maturities, as well as general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch has also withdrawn OXY's short-term IDR and CP ratings at 'B', removed the Rating Watch Negative and assigned a Stable Outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The main driver for the upgrade and revised Outlook is the company's unsecured notes issuance, which Fitch anticipates will help bridge OXY's large maturity wall in the absence of material near-term asset sales. Demonstrated capital market access also reduces future event risk around possible liability management exercises, and may also create uplift in the company's de-leveraging program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings were withdrawn with the following reason Bonds Were Prefunded/Called/Redeemed/Exchanged/Cancelled/Repaid Early</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Issuance Helps Bridge Maturity Wall: The senior unsecured notes issuance helps bridge OXY's large maturity wall in the absence of near-term asset sales. While OXY's maturity wall remains a source of differentiated risk among peers, the current issuance lowers event risk around possible liability management exercises in the future. Fitch expects the combination of bond proceeds, FCF and revolver availability should be sufficient to get the company past its near-term maturities. Demonstrated market access may also create flexibility around the timing of asset sales, and could benefit the perceived value of the company's publicly traded WES units, which have more than tripled from lows earlier this year. Should the unsecured bond market close to OXY in the future due to another sustained oil price crash (after a second wave of coronavirus infections), the company maintains the flexibility to issue secured or guaranteed debt under existing indentures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Limited Traction on Asset Sales: OXY continues to see limited traction on asset sales. To date, the company sold $5.5 billion in assets to pay down debt. OXY's original target of over $15 billion in asset sales 12-24 months after closing is unlikely, although the modest rebound in oil pricing and fundamentals seen since the spring could still accelerate a portion of sales. Several of the company's assets are less correlated to oil, including the <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum Corporation</span> legacy land grant position, comprising 5 million acres across Wyoming, Utah and Colorado and consisting of 1 million surface acres and rights to 4 million subsurface acres, and other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >High Maturity Wall: OXY's near-term maturity wall is high, with $7.4 billion due in 2021, $4.6 billion in 2022 and another $1.2 billion in 2023. A significant portion of 2021 maturities, totaling $2.43 billion, are due in 1Q21, less than one year away. The $7.4 billion includes $992 million in 2036 zero-coupon notes (legacy Anadarko notes), as it has recently been economic for noteholders to put those notes back to the company. The put feature in the notes is annual, with the next put date October 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Low Prices Increase Near-Term Leverage: In response to demand reductions associated with coronavirus-related shutdowns, Fitch lowered its base case WTI oil price deck to $32/barrel in 2020 and $42/barrel in 2021, before flipping back to $50/barrel in 2022 and $52/barrel in 2023. Lower oil prices, in conjunction with lower expected asset sales, resulted in elevated near-term leverage for OXY. For purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Organic Measures to Defend Credit: In response to the collapse in oil prices, OXY announced the following credit defensive measures: the near-elimination of its dividend (cut to $0.01/share), which will reduce dividend payments by $2.7 billion on a run rate basis; multiple reductions in 2020 capex, including the most recent cuts to the $2.4 billion-$2.6 billion level; relief on cash payments for the company's $10 billion Berkshire preferred notes; and early achievement of increased overhead and opex synergy targets. In the near term, FCF is also helped by OXY's 2020 hedge position of approximately 350,000bpd of oil with a three-way collar, with realized prices equal to Brent plus $10 at $45 or lower. Fitch believes the company could shrink capex to enhance FCF further should it choose this route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deal Should Strengthen Long-Term Profile: To the degree the company overcomes its financing issues, Fitch believes the Anadarko acquisition will ultimately strengthen OXY's business and operational profile over the longer term, assuming a recovery in oil prices. OXY's post-acquisition size has more than doubled to just under 1.4 million boepd and, on a pro forma basis, par with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (A/Stable). Oxy is the largest producer in the Permian and DJ basins, and a top producer in the Gulf of Mexico. The ability to deploy OXY's technological, subsurface and operational expertise to Anadarko's holdings (particularly in the Permian) is expected to create significant value in a more normalized oil price environment by lowering unit costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: OXY enjoys modest but meaningful integration benefits through its chemicals segment, which has a top-three position in most basic chemicals it produces in North America, including chlorine, vinyl, PVC and caustic soda, and through its midstream segment, including gas processing plants, pipelines, CO2 infrastructure, storage, power generation and gas marketing businesses. Chemicals in particular historically contribute strong FCF given their limited reinvestment needs, which the company has been able to redeploy elsewhere. Diversification from non-E&P businesses has dropped on a percentage basis following the Anadarko acquisition but remains a source of differentiation from other credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating Derivation versus Peers: OXY's credit profile is mixed. OXY's rating is currently dominated by refinancing concerns given the looming maturity wall and difficulty in meeting its maturity schedule with organic cash flows even as the market for energy assets remains hobbled by high volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, the company has several long-term characteristics of a high-grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at just under 1.4 million boepd, it is among the largest independents, in line with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>, and is significantly larger than E&Ps such as <span class="companylink">Devon Energy Corporation</span> (BBB/Stable), <span class="companylink">Apache Corporation</span> (BB+/Stable) and <span class="companylink">Marathon Oil Corporation</span> (BBB/Negative). Upstream diversification is also above-average, given OXY's number-one position in the Permian and the DJ, number-four position in the GOM, and upstream diversification in Middle Eastern countries, which remains a differentiating factor versus peers. Integration with chemicals and midstream also sets OXY apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case WTI oil price of $32/barrel in 2020, $42/barrel in 2021, $50/barrel in 2022 and $52/barrel in 2023 and the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $1.85/mcf in 2020 and $2.45/mcf across the forecast;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex of $2.6 billion in 2020, $5.1 billion in 2021, $5.9 billion in 2022 and $6.7 billion in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--90% of 2036 zero-coupon bonds assumed put to the company in October 2020;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$300 million in asset sales in 2020 and $2.2 billion in 2021, with proceeds applied to debt paydown;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends of $1.6 billion in 2020, falling to de minimis levels in 2021, before rising in line with a rising price deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained recovery in oil prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Additional progress in redeeming or refinancing the company's near-term maturity wall;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage at or below 3.5x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage at or below 3.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further sustained leg down in oil prices;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess reliance on revolver for refinancing of maturity wall, especially if done without announced asset sales;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Impairments to liquidity;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage above 3.7x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage above 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Tight Liquidity: Liquidity is limited in the context of low oil prices, limited asset sales and a large maturity wall. Cash on hand at March 31, 2020 was $2.01 billion (excluding $242 million in restricted cash), and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver (maturing January 2023) for total liquidity of $7.01 billion. The company has maturities of up to $992 million in October 2020, $6.4 billion in 2021, $4.7 billion in 2022 and an additional $1.2 billion due 2023.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-14 May 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (OXY) to 'BB-' from 'BB+', downgraded its senior unsecured notes and revolver to 'BB-'/RR4 from 'BB+'/RR4, and maintained its Short-Term IDR and commercial paper ratings at 'B'. The ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade comes in the context of protracted low oil prices and little progress in asset sales needed to tackle the sizable maturity wall put in place to fund the Anadarko acquisition. With oil prices stuck below $30 WTI and the forward strip indicating a lower-for-longer recovery may be in place for some time, the prospects for incremental asset sales remain slow, even as near-term maturities loom ($7.4 billion due in 2021 including the 2036 zero coupons, $4.6 billion in 2022, and $1.2 billion in 2023). A significant portion of the 2021 maturities are due within one year or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >While OXY has undertaken several actions to boost organic FCF generation (cutting its dividend by 86% to conserve approximately $2.4 billion per year, cutting 2020 capex repeatedly and getting relief on cash payments for its preferreds), Fitch believes the company will still require external measures to address its maturity wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The RWN reflects the heightened event risk that the company may undertake liability management exercises to address its capital structure to alleviate current constraints if low oil prices persist and additional asset sales are not closed in the near term. This could include the issuance of new secured or guaranteed debt, debt exchanges, or the issuance of equity or equity-like securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >In accordance with Fitch's policies, the issuer appealed and provided additional information to Fitch that resulted in a rating action that is different from the original rating committee outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Limited Traction on Asset Sales: The main driver of OXY's downgrade is the lack of traction to date on asset sales required to address its pending maturity wall. To date, the company sold $5.5 billion in assets to pay down debt. OXY's original target of over $15 billion in asset sales 12-24 months after closing appears unlikely absent a turnaround in oil pricing and fundamentals. Some of the assets on offer are less correlated to oil, including the Anadarko legacy land grant position (5 million acres across Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, consisting of 1 million surface acres and rights to 4 million subsurface acres), and other assets. OXY has given a new lower target of over $2 billion in near-term asset sales, which includes the land grant, but even this could be challenging given the severe macroeconomic turbulence linked to COVID-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher Maturity Wall: OXY has a substantial maturity wall of $7.4 billion due in 2021, $4.6 billion in 2022 and another $1.2 billion in 2023. In terms of the 2021 maturities, a significant portion of these ($2.43 billion) is due in 1Q21, less than one year away. The $7.4 billion includes $992 million in 2036 zero-coupon notes (legacy Anadarko notes), given it is now economic for noteholders to put those notes back to the company in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Lower Prices Increase Near-Term Leverage: In response to demand reductions associated with the pandemic shutdowns, Fitch lowered its base case WTI oil price deck to $32/barrel in 2020 and $42/barrel in 2021, before flipping back to $50/barrel in 2022 and $52/barrel in 2023. Lower oil prices, in conjunction with lower expected asset sales, have increased our estimates for OXY's leverage to 5.0x in 2020 and 3.4x in 2021. Note that for purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch assigns 50% equity credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% cumulative perpetual preferred stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Organic Measures to Defend Credit: In response to the collapse in oil prices, OXY announced several credit defensive measures, including an 86% reduction in its dividend, which will reduce dividend payments from $2.8 billion to just over $400 million on a run rate basis; multiple reductions in 2020 capex including the most recent cuts to the $2.4 billion- $2.6 billion level; and relief on cash payments for the company's $10 billion Berkshire preferred notes. In the near term, FCF is also helped by OXY's 2020 hedge position of approximately 350,000bpd of oil with a three-way collar, with realized prices equal to Brent plus $10 at $45 or lower. Fitch believes the company could shrink capex further should it chose this route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deal Should Strengthen Long-Term Profile: To the degree the company gets past its financing issues, the acquisition should ultimately strengthen OXY's business and operational profile over the long term, assuming a recovery in oil prices. OXY's post-acquisition size has more than doubled to just under 1.4 million boepd and, on a pro forma basis, par with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (A/Stable). Oxy is the largest producer in the Permian and DJ basins, and a top producer in the Gulf of Mexico. The ability to deploy OXY's technological, sub-surface and operational expertise to APC's holdings (particularly in the Permian) is expected to create significant value in a more normalized oil price environment by lowering unit costs. OXY has initiatives to capture an incremental $1.2 billion in SG&A and operating cost reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: OXY enjoys modest but meaningful integration benefits through its chemicals segment (OxyChem), which has a top three position in most basic chemicals it produces in North America (chlorine, vinyl, PVC and caustic soda), and through its midstream segment (gas processing plants, pipelines, CO2 infrastructure, storage, power generation and gas marketing businesses). Chemicals in particular have historically contributed strong FCF given their limited reinvestment needs, which the company has been able to redeploy elsewhere. Diversification from non-E&P businesses has dropped on a percentage basis following the APC acquisition but remains a source of differentiation from other credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating Derivation versus Peers: OXY's credit profile is mixed. OXY's rating is currently dominated by refinancing concerns given the looming maturity wall and difficulty in meeting its maturity schedule with organic cash flows even as the market for energy assets remains hobbled by high volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >At the same time, the company has several long-term characteristics of a high-grade credit. In terms of size and scale, at just under 1.4 million boepd, it is among the largest independents, in line with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (A/Stable), and is significantly larger than E&Ps such as Devon (BBB/Stable), Apache (BBB/Negative) and <span class="companylink">Marathon Oil</span> (BBB/Negative). Upstream diversification is also above-average, given OXY's No. 1 position in the Permian and the DJ, No. 4 position in the GOM and upstream diversification in Middle Eastern countries, which remains a differentiating factor versus peers. Integration with chemicals and midstream also sets OXY apart from peers. No Country Ceiling, operating environment or parent-subsidiary-linkages affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Base Case WTI oil price of $32/barrel in 2020, $42/barrel in 2021, $50/barrel in 2022 and $52/barrel in 2023 and the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Henry Hub natural gas prices of $1.85/mcf in 2020, $2.10/mcf in 2021, $2.25/mcf in 2022, and $2.50/mcf in 2023 and the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Capex of $2.6 billion in 2020, $5.1 billion in 2021, $5.3 billion in 2022 and $5.6 billion in 2023.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--In addition to existing maturity schedule, 90% of 2036 zero-coupon bonds assumed put to the company in October of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--$200 million in asset sales in 2020 and $2.0 billion in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Dividends of $1.6 billion in 2020, falling to just over $400 million in 2021 before rising across the forecast in line with a rising price deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Sustained recovery in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Asset sales or debt issuance sufficient in combination with FCF to allow for refinancing of maturity wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage at or below 3.8x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage at or below 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Further sustained leg down in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Excess reliance on revolver for refinancing of maturity wall, especially if done without announced asset sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Impairments to liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle debt/EBITDA leverage above 4.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >--Mid-cycle FFO lease-adjusted leverage above 4.3x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Tight Liquidity: Liquidity is very tight in the context of low oil prices, limited asset sales and a large maturity wall. Cash on hand at March 31, 2020 was $2.01 billion (excluding $242 million in restricted cash), and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver (maturing January 2023) for total liquidity of $7.01 billion. The company has maturities of up to $992 million in October of this year, $6.4 billion in 2021, $4.7 billion in 2022 and an additional $1.2 billion due 2023. Fitch believes there is heightened risk the company may undertake liability management exercises to address its capital structure to alleviate current constraints if low oil prices persist and additional asset sales are not closed in the near term.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-23 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> downgraded Western Midstream Operating, LP's (WES; fka <span class="companylink">Western Gas Partners, LP</span>) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings to 'BB+' from 'BBB-' and placed the ratings of the partnership on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The senior unsecured notes have a Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. The downgrade reflects the deterioration in WES's credit quality following Fitch's negative rating action of its owner and major counterparty, <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corporation</span>(OXY; BB+/RWN). WES's counterparty risk is significantly heightened, as WES is now predominately exposed to non-investment grade counterparties. The ratings take into account WES's significant dependence on OXY and its performance is largely driven by OXY's balance sheet. OXY's rating serves as cap on WES's rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch believes that for 2020 and 2021 WES gathering & processing operations in the DJ basin and non-core regions outside the Permian will remain challenged by the declining drilling activities of its producer customers under an adverse commodities price environment, particularly following OXY's significant reduction in capex from $5.2 billion-$5.4 billion to $3.5 billion-$3.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Rating Watch mainly reflects the concern that WES will operate with leverage above the negative rating sensitivity of 4.5x beyond 2020 without undertaking meaningful steps to improve its balance sheet. While Fitch recognizes the operational headwind faced by WES due to curtailed production by E&P producer customers under the current commodities price environment, Fitch notes that WES has the financial levers including capex and distribution reduction to maintain leverage below 4.5x in the forecast years. It is unclear at this point whether WES will use such measures to enhance its balance sheet and free cashflow. Fitch intends to resolve the Watch when there is more clarity by WES on its financial policy in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Elevated Leverage: Fitch forecasts WES's leverage (total debt/adjusted EBITDA) to be 4.6x-4.8x at YE 2020 and to trend above 5.0x for 2021, driven by deteriorating volume and operating performance in regions outside the Permian. Fitch previously expected WES's leverage to be elevated in 2020 but improve below the negative rating sensitivity of 4.5x by YE20. There was already less visibility of volume growth for WES's core businesses in the Permian and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin under OXY's production development plans following the ownership change for WES. The recent capex reductions by OXY will further hamper WES's growth in 2020 and 2021, particularly in the DJ basin, in Fitch's view. Despite the operational headwind, WES currently has the financial flexibility, which includes significant reduction in its capex and distribution level, in order to strengthen its balance sheet and to operate with leverage below 4.5x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Operational Headwinds: Fitch believes that for WES segments outside the Permian will continue to be challenged driven by capital reduction by E&P producer customers under the unfavorable commodity price environment. WES's major counterparty, OXY, recently announced it will reduce 2020 capex by 32%, to $3.5 billion-$3.7 billion. Fitch views that OXY's capital reduction will have a greater impact on WES's (DJ) segment, leading to EBTIDA erosion in the DJ basin for 2020 and 2021. As of February 2020, WES is expected to generate 38% of its 2020 EBTIDA in the DJ basin. Additionally, Fitch also forecasts performance in other non-core regions, which comprises ~11% of WES 2020 EBITDA, to decline through 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Counterparty Credit Risk: Fitch notes that WES's counterparty credit quality has significantly worsened following the negative rating action at OXY. WES is now predominately exposed to non-investment grade counterparties, as Fitch expects OXY to remain a major customer that accounts for approximately 70% of revenues for WES in 2020. Since WES is dependent on OXY for its cash flows and future growth, OXY's operational and financial health have a strong bearing on the credit profile of WES. Given the customer concentration risk, deterioration in OXY's credit quality will be deleterious to WES's credit profile, and the rating of OXY serves as a cap on the rating of WES.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Growth Uncertainties under OXY: Uncertainties around future ownership remains an overhanging issue for WES, as OXY remains committed to lower its 57.5% stake in WES to approximately 50% following WES's recent deconsolidation from OXY's balance sheet. There is less visibility around WES's near-term volume growth in its two core regions, the Permian and the DJ basin, since the ownership changes for WES. It remains unclear how OXY's recent capital reduction plan will impact WES's operation in the Permian, although the strategic, operational alignment between OXY and WES in the Permian remains intact given the good fit between legacy Anadarko's and WES's assets in the basin. OXY reeling back legacy Anadarko's historic focus on the DJ basin may materially impede WES's future growth. WES also stated to grow the company more independently through third party volume, but Fitch believes such growth will now be much slower, as upstream customers are becoming increasingly capital disciplined with their production spending under the adverse commodities price environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset and Contract Profile: Fitch believes that WES will generate close to 98% of its gross margin from fee-based and fixed price contracts in 2020, and WES had limited exposure to direct commodity price exposure historically. Additionally, WES is also diversified geographically, underpinned by Minimum Volume Commitments (MVC) and Cost-of-Service (COS) contracts that each provide stable cash flow, relative to the more standard requirements-contracts prevalent in the gathering industry. For FY19, approximately 65% of WES's natural-gas throughput was protected by either minimum-volume commitments with associated deficiency payments. For the same period, approximately 78% of its crude-oil, NGLs, and produced-water throughput were supported by either minimum-volume commitments with associated deficiency payments, or cost-of-service commitments. As of YE19, WES also had a long-term weighted average contract life of more than eight years collectively for its gas, crude, and water businesses. Additionally, WES also has a portfolio of equity investments, including ownership interests in long haul pipelines in the Permian, which should continue to provide stable cash flow in the near term. Fitch believes that the Permian will continue to be the cornerstone of growth for WES.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >With respect to WES, the best comparable among the gathering and processing-focused entities is <span class="companylink">EnLink Midstream, LLC</span> (ENLC; BB+/Negative). Both companies have similar degree of geographic diversification (moderate diversification) and customer concentration. WES's YE19 leverage (debt/EBITDA) of 4.6x-4.8x is better than ENLC's, which Fitch projects to be above 5.0x.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
<span class="companylink">EQM Midstream Partners, LP</span> (EQM; BB/Negative) is a G&P company whose ratings are capped by its major E&P customer <span class="companylink">EQT Corporation</span> (EQT; BB/Negative). In the case of EQT-EQM and OXY-WES, Fitch believes that the G&P company's vulnerability to default is presently virtually equal to the E&P company's' vulnerability to default. Fitch monitors such relationships closely, because midstream side businesses and/or the approach of contract expirations could lead to a notching of the G&P company from the E&P company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Fitch commodities price deck of Henry Hub prices at $1.85/mcf in 2020 and $2.1 in 2021; WTI oil price of $38 in 2020, and $45 in 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Declining throughput volume and operating performance in segments outside of Permian through 2021;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Customers abide by their contracts with WES, and do not seek amendments which detract from medium-term cash flow stability, or otherwise lead to insufficient EBITDA to keep leverage at policy;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- 2020 Leverage of 4.6x-4.8x;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- 2020 Total capex below management's 4Q19 earnings call guided $875-950 million;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Distribution remains level throughout the forecast years;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Rating case does not assume a significant change in the financial policy due to potential ownership changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Leverage (Debt/Adj. EBITDA) at or below 4.5x and distribution coverage ratio above 1.1x on a sustained basis, provided gross margin is expected to remain above 90% fee based or fixed price would likely lead to Positive Rating Action;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Asset and business line expansion leading to a more diversified cash flow profile;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Positive rating action at OXY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Leverage at or above 5.5x and distribution coverage ratio below 1.1x on a sustained basis, driven by financial policy or significantly lower EBITDA and cash flow would result in negative rating action;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Negative rating action at OXY;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Material unfavorable changes in sponsor support and contract mix;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >-Negative change in law (either new laws, or rulings on old laws) which cause volumetric declines and pushes profitability lower and leverage higher on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Adoption of a growth funding strategy which does not include a significant equity (inclusive of retained earnings) component.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Manageable Liquidity: As of Dec. 31, 2019, WES had approximately $100 million in cash and $380 million in outstanding borrowings and $4.6 million in outstanding letters of credit. The outstanding revolver borrowings were subsequently repaid by the senior notes issuance in January 2020. Fitch expects that liquidity will remain adequate over the near term. The nearest debt maturity for WES is its $500 million senior unsecured notes due in 2021. In December 2019, WES extended the maturity date of the RCF from February 2024 to February 2025. The credit facility requires that WES maintain a consolidated leverage ratio at or below 5.0x, or a consolidated leverage ratio of 5.5x with respect to quarters ending in the 270-day period immediately following certain acquisitions. WES is currently in compliance with this covenant and Fitch expects it will remain so for the balance of its forecast period.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Fitch Ratings-New York-23 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded Centurion Pipeline Company LLC's (Centurion) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB-' from 'BB'. In addition, Fitch has downgraded the senior secured term loan and revolver rating to 'BB'/'RR1' from 'BB+'/'RR1'. The Recovery Rating of 'RR1' reflects Fitch's expectations of an outstanding recovery in the range of 91% to 100% if there is an event of default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The downgrade to Centurion reflects the negative rating action at Centurion's primary counterparty, <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>.(OXY; BB+/Rating Watch Negative [RWN]). Fitch had previously written that a substantial credit quality deterioration at OXY could lead to a downgrade at Centurion. OXY's IDR was downgraded reflecting negative impacts from the sharp drop in oil prices, which has caused Fitch to revise its base case price deck lower, resulting in weaker metrics and cash flow protections. The oil price collapse has also made OXY's ongoing sales of energy assets more challenging, prompting OXY to reduce capex spending and moderate its production activity in the Permian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Centurion's rating also reflects its elevated near term leverage from historically low levels. Fitch expects year end 2020 leverage to be in the range of 3.5x-3.7x from a modest 2.1x leverage at year-end 2019. The ratings also take into account concentration risk from OXY and Centurion's limited size and scale. The rating is constrained by the fact that nearly all cash flows are generated from a single pipeline system, although the company is now expanding with its JV interest in Wink-to-Webster and the Augustus Pipeline, but remains focused on the Permian basin. Given its single basin focus and lack of business line diversity, Centurion is subject to event risk should there be a slow down or longer term disruption of production in the Permian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >This risk is mitigated to an extent by some stable cash flow assurance in the form of minimum revenue commitments from OXY and another investment-grade counterparty which provides some downside protection; and the importance of the asset to OXY given that the Centurion system spans across both basins within the Permian and has access to Midland and Cushing hubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's concerns around near term challenges in a weak oil price environment and its continued impact on producer activity. Additionally, a resolution of the OXY RWN with a downgrade is also relevant, particularly if volumes nominated by OXY are starting to approach the level of volumes which underlies the 2020 Minimum Revenue Commitment level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Near-Term Leverage Trending Higher: Centurion has historically maintained low leverage and strong interest and distribution coverage relative to midstream peers. Leverage is expected to be elevated in the near term with expectation of moderating producer activity in the backdrop of macro headwinds in a low oil price environment. Fitch expects year-end 2020 leverage in the range of 3.5x-3.7x given higher committed growth spending, barring unforeseen events such as increases in spending or acquisitions. Fitch believes leverage is critical to Centurion's credit profile due to the company's concentrated counterparty exposure and limited geographic diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Counterparty Exposure: Centurion derives a significant proportion of its revenues from OXY, which is the primary counterparty on its system. Revenues from Oxy are supported by long term contracts with some minimum revenue commitments. Centurion has significant customer concentration to OXY and is expected to remain Centurion's largest customer in the near to intermediate term, as it provides OXY with logistical assets that support its operations. In addition to its own production, OXY also on-ships for others. Although the assets are critical to OXY's production in the Permian, Fitch typically views midstream providers with high counterparty concentration as having exposure to outsized event risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Lack of Diversification: Centurion derives nearly all of its cash flows from a single asset located in the Permian basin and extending northeast to Cushing, OK. The lack of diversity exposes Centurion to geographic and asset concentration. Furthermore, Centurion lacks customer diversification given that OXY accounts for the significant proportion of its volumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Steady Cash Flows: Centurion's operations are underpinned by long-term agreements in place with OXY, which includes a minimum revenue commitment extending until 2029. Centurion also has a long-term throughput and deficiency (T&D) agreement in place with another investment-grade customer. These minimum revenue commitments ensure cash flow assurance and provide some volumetric downside protection but these minimum revenue commitments decline over the contract period. The new projects including Wink-to-Webster and Augustus pipeline will be supported by long term take or pay contracts from counterparties that are predominantly investment grade. In addition, the Southeast New Mexico (SENM) oil gathering system has significant acreage dedication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Supportive Sponsor: Centurion's sponsor, Encap Flatrock Midstream (EnCap) has been and is expected to remain supportive of the operating profile of Centurion. As of September 2019, EnCap owned 100% of Centurion. EnCap committed equity for the purchase of Oxy's pipeline assets in 2018 and continues to provide the Company with assistance in gaining insights into new areas. EnCap supports Centurion's growth as the Company reinvests its cash flows into the business. This further highlights EnCap's commitment going forward as Centurion continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >ESG - Governance: Centurion has a relevance score of 4 for Group Structure and Financial transparency as the company operates under a somewhat complex group structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Centurion's rating is constrained by its size and lack of geographic diversification. Centurion also has significant customer concentration with <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span>. (OXY; BB+/ RWN), contributing nearly 60% of revenues for FYE 2019. The rating also takes into account that nearly all cash flows are generated from a single pipeline system, although the company is now expanding with its investment in the Augustus Pipeline and joint venture interest in Wink-to-Webster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Both Hess Midstream Operations, LP (HESM OpCo; IDR BB+/Stable Outlook) and Centurion are single basin midstream companies with concentrated but high quality counterparty risk. HESM OpCo's parent is <span class="companylink">Hess Corporation</span> (HES; BBB-/Stable). HESM OpCo is located in the Bakken whereas Centurion is based in the Permian basin, where Fitch expects curtailed producer activity in the near term. Although HESM OpCo's leverage is higher than Centurion's, HESM OpCo receives protection from volume downside and other risks from its investment grade parent, HES in the form of some MVCs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Liquidity in Near Term: As of Sept. 30, 2019, Centurion had approximately $65 million in cash and cash equivalents. Centurion also has a credit facility which provides for $350 million term loan and a $100 million revolver. The revolver also has a sublimit of $25 million for letters of credit. The Credit Facility can be used to fund capital needs of Centurion and subsidiaries. As of Sept. 30, 2019, no amount was outstanding under the revolver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. Beginning 1Q19, the term loan has an annual amortization of $3.5 million. The senior secured term loan and secured revolver rank pari passu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Under the facility, Centurion is required to maintain two financial covenants: (1) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of at least 1.10x and (2) net total leverage ratio not exceeding 4.75x. As of Sept. 30, 2019, Centurion was in compliance with the covenants and Fitch expects the Company to maintain compliance in the near to intermediate term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Debt Maturity Profile: The revolver matures on September 2023.The Senior Secured Term Loan B with an outstanding amount of $348 million has a maturity of September 2025.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >
                        <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>-Chicago-20 March 2020: <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of <span class="companylink"><b>Occidental Petroleum</b> Corp</span> to 'BB+' from 'BBB+', and placed its Ratings on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). Fitch has also withdrawn the Long-Term IDRs for <span class="companylink">Anadarko Petroleum Corporation</span>, Anadarko Holding Company, and <span class="companylink">Kerr-McGee Corp</span>, following the completion of debt exchanges of all outstanding Anadarko debt for equivalent OXY debt. In addition, Fitch has downgraded OXY's short-term IDR and commercial paper ratings to 'B' from 'F2'.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The main driver of the downgrade is the sharp drop in oil prices, which resulted in weaker near-term leverage metrics and cash flow protections for OXY. More significantly, the oil price collapse has significantly increased execution risk around remaining planned asset sales needed to pay off pending maturities taken out to finance the APC acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The RWN reflects the heightened event risk the company may look to address its capital structure to alleviate current constraints if low oil prices persist. This could happen through any of a number of wide-ranging measures that stressed E&P companies used during the last downturn to create liquidity and capital structure relief, including exchanges, issuance of equity or equity-like securities, or potentially secured debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >To counteract the pressure from low oil prices, OXY has taken a number of credit supportive actions recently to boost its organic FCF generation, including cutting its dividend by 86% (saving approximately $2.4 billion per year), and cutting 2020 capex by an additional $1.7 billion. Despite these improvements in organic cash generation, Fitch believes the company still requires a level of external measures to meet its debt repayment targets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The ratings were withdrawn with the following reason Bonds Were Prefunded/Called/Redeemed/Exchanged/Cancelled/Repaid Early</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Rating Drivers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Higher Near-Term Leverage: Fitch's lower base case WTI oil price deck (2020: $38/barrel, 2021: $45/barrel, 2022: $50/barrel, 2023 and the long-term: $52/barrel), along with the agency's expectations for moderating levels of asset sales ($7.5 billion in sales split evenly between 2020 and 2021), have pushed our estimates for OXY's leverage above earlier levels to 3.6x in 2020, and 2.4x in 2021. If OXY were unable to complete asset sales at this level, metrics under Fitch's base case deck would rise to 4.0x in 2020. Note that for purposes of calculating leverage, Fitch assigns 50% Equity Credit for the $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway 8% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock based on the structural features of the notes as analyzed under Fitch's "Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Asset Sale Risk Rises: Execution risk around the asset sales required to achieve post-transaction de-leveraging targets has increased. To date, the company has sold $5.5 billion in assets, as well as FCF, to pay down $7.0 billion in debt. OXY's target of over $15 billion in asset sales 12-24 months after closing implies $9.5 billion in incremental sales by August 2021. At the same time, the company has put new assets on the block that are less directly correlated to oil, including the Anadarko legacy land grant position (5 million acres across WY, UT and CO, comprised of 1 million surface acres and rights to 4 million subsurface acres).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Dividend Cut: In response to the collapse in oil prices, OXY announced several credit defensive measures, including an 86% reduction in its dividend, which should reduce dividend payments from $2.8 billion to just over $400 million on a run rate basis. This cut equates to a $5.00/barrel reduction in the company's cost structure, which should lower the company's break-even to the low-to-mid $30 range, excluding cash settlements from existing hedges. The dividend was a key overhang on the credit prior to the cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Capex Reduction: OXY also cut its 2020 capex to $3.5 billion-$3.7 billion, well below the $5.2 billion-$5.4 billion level announced in February. These cuts will increase its ability to generate organic FCF. 2020 FCF should also be helped by OXY's 2020 hedge position of approximately 350,000 bpd of oil with a three way collar, with realized prices equal to Brent plus $10 at $45 or lower. The agency thinks the company has room to shrink given its size should it chose this route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Deal Strengthens Long-Term Profile: To the degree the company gets past its financing issues, the acquisition should strengthen its business and operational profile over the long term. OXY's post-acquisition size has more than doubled to just under 1.4 million boepd and is on par with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (A/Stable). Oxy is also the largest producer in the Permian and DJ basins, and a top producer in the Gulf of Mexico. The ability to deploy OXY's technological, sub-surface, and operational expertise to APC's holdings (particularly in the Permian) is expected to create significant value in a more normalized oil price environment by lowering unit costs. Synergies include $1.1 billion in overhead and opex synergies ($799 million and $83 million achieved to date), capital synergies of $900 million, and capital reduction of over $3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Integrated Producer: OXY enjoys modest but meaningful integration benefits through its chemicals segment (OxyChem), which has a top three position in most basic chemicals it produces in North America (chlorine, vinyl, PVC and caustic soda), and through its midstream segment (gas processing plants, pipelines, CO2 infrastructure, storage, power generation and gas marketing businesses). Chemicals in particular have historically contributed strong FCF given their limited reinvestment needs, which the company has been able to redeploy elsewhere. Diversification from chemicals has dropped on a percentage basis following the acquisition but the company has seen increased diversification within the upstream from OXY's newly acquired positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Hedging Position: To help protect cash flows in a downside scenario, OXY has hedged a material portion of its 2020 oil production. Currently, the company has 350,000 bpd of oil hedges in place in the form a three-way collar ($74.16/$55/$45), Fitch views this as incrementally favorable to the credit profile, given the protections to cash flow it provides in 2020 but note the lack of hedge protection in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Derivation Summary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Rating Derivation Versus Peers: OXY's credit profile is mixed. In terms of size and scale, at just under 1.4 million boepd, it is among the largest independents, in line with <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> (A/Stable), and is significantly larger than E&Ps such as Devon (BBB/Stable), Apache (BBB/Negative) and <span class="companylink">Marathon Oil</span> (BBB/Negative). Upstream diversification is also above-average, as OXY a diverse upstream position in the Permian (#1 position), the DJ (#1), the GOM (#4), Latin America, and Middle East countries, which remains a differentiating factor. Integration with chemicals and midstream also sets OXY apart from peers. At the same time, financial flexibility is low given pending maturities due, and the need for near-term asset sales or other measures to fully make these repayments. No country ceiling, operating environment, or parent-subsidiary-linkages affect the rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Key Assumptions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Base Case WTI oil price of $38 in 2020, $45 in 2021, $50 in 2022, and $52 in 2023 and the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Henry Hub natural gas prices of $1.85/mcf in 2020, $2.10/mcf in 2021, $2.25/mcf in 2022, and $2.50/mcf in 2023 and the long term;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Capex of $3.7 billion in 2020, $5.3 billion in 2021, $5.8 billion in 2022 and $6.2 billion in 2023;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- $7.5 billion in asset sales, split evenly between 2020 and 2021 with proceeds from sales plus free cash flow applied to debt repayment;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Dividends of $1.6 billion in 2020, falling to just over $400 million in 2021 before rising across the forecast in line with a rising price deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >RATING SENSITIVITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- De-risking the 2021 maturities by August of 2020, through incremental asset sales or other means;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- FFO lease-adjusted leverage of approximately 2.8x on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Stand-alone debt/EBITDA leverage of approximately 2.5x on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Sustained improvement in oil prices supporting higher metrics and accelerated asset sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Failure to de-risk the 2021 maturities by August of 2020, through incremental asset sales or other means;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- FFO lease-adjusted leverage above 3.2x on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Stand-alone debt/EBITDA leverage above 2.8x on a sustained basis;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >- Further leg down in oil prices resulting in weaker base case credit metrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Liquidity and Debt Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Adequate Near Term Liquidity: On an LTM basis, OXY's liquidity was adequate. Cash on hand at Dec. 31, 2019 was $3.03 billion (excluding $480 million in restricted cash), and there was no draw on the company's committed $5.0 billion senior unsecured revolver (maturing January 2023) for total liquidity of $8.08 billion. However, as stated earlier, while the company has taken steps to enhance its financial flexibility, OXY is still faced with the issue of pending debt refinancing over the next few quarters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >Copyright © 2020 by <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings Ltd</span>. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.</p>

                     <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings, Inc</span>. is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (the "NRSRO"). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph" >), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on Form NRSRO (the "non-NRSROs") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.</p>
