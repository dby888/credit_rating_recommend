The Rating Outlook is Stable.\n\nWalmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position. The company had revenue of $681 billion in 2024, and has produced consistently positive comparable store sales (comps), with a consistent financial strategy, resulting in stable EBITDAR leverage at or below 2x. Fitch projects long-term organic annual revenue growth in the low-single digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth. However, near-term results may be volatile due to moderating U.S. consumer sentiment and cost pressures from Walmart's exposure to evolving U.S. tariff policies.\n\nFitch expects internally generated cash flow to remain substantial, with annual FCF averaging around $3 billion (adding back lease depreciation) after annual capex of at least $20 billion and dividends of approximately $7 billion."", 'key rating drivers': ""Massive Scale, Business Breadth: Walmart is the world's largest retailer, with $681 billion in revenue in 2024 across 10,750 stores in 19 countries and e-commerce websites. Walmart's sales mix is diverse, with just over half of its revenue derived from groceries and the remainder from general merchandise categories. The company's retail formats include discount centers, supercenters, membership clubs and smaller neighborhood markets, in addition to its digital presence.\n\nWalmart has identified nascent revenue streams, including digital advertising and third-party seller initiatives like marketplace and supply chain services. The company is also investing in in-store technology, customer service, and private label offerings to support topline growth in its existing business. Walmart's sizable internally generated cash flow and close customer connections enable significant investments that support market share expansion over time.\n\nNear-Term Challenges: Fitch expects the U.S. retail sector to face near-term challenges, including declines in consumer sentiment, business disruption and rising costs related to evolving U.S. tariff policies. Discretionary categories could see revenue down as much as mid-single digits with outsized EBITDA declines given tariff-related cost pressure.\n\nFitch expects U.S. retailers will be affected by these challenges, but Walmart's strong position and merchandising focus on groceries and other staples should allow it to manage through near-term volatility better than most of its peers. Fitch expects Walmart's revenue in 2025 to decline modestly, with potential EBITDA declines closer to 10%. This assumes the company will absorb some cost increases to drive market share longer term, in line with recent comments from management.\n\nOmnichannel Evolution Supports Market Share: Walmart's good sales trajectory benefits from its omnichannel focus. Longer-term omnichannel winners are retailers with strong physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory. Better-positioned incumbents like Walmart, with good customer relationships and internally generated cash flow, can strengthen their omnichannel models over time.\n\nCapital Investments Drive Differentiation: Walmart is directing its sizable capex into investments to accelerate topline growth through better customer experience and improved efficiency. The company is using data analytics and automation to optimize inventory forecasting and flow, improve supply chain speed and efficiency, and refocus labor efforts toward customer-facing activities. The company is also adding features designed to improve customer service like self-checkout models and simplified store pickup operations.\n\nWarehouse Club and International Growth: Beyond its core discount/supercenter business, Walmart is exposed to the growing warehouse club business through its Sam's Club operation, which generated $90 billion of revenue in 2024. Internationally ($122 billion of 2024 revenue), Walmart has focused on markets it believes have above-average potential. The company's significant international presence includes its 71% stake in Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. (about $52 billion) and fully owned businesses in Canada ($23 billion) and China ($20 billion). The company also owns about 85% of leading Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart.\n\nStable Longer-Term Operating Results: Since 2017, Walmart has had good growth in U.S. comps, which have led to EBITDA expansion over time. Longer-term, Fitch expects Walmart to grow revenue and EBITDA 2% to 3% annually, with potential for additional growth if the company's automation and other omnichannel initiatives yield significant benefits. This contrasts with management's target of growing annual revenue 4% longer term. Fitch's projections consider the ongoing competition across Walmart's merchandise categories and the need for continuous investment in service and value initiatives.\n\nStrong Cash Flow: Walmart's cash flow generation is strong, with FCF after dividends (adding back lease depreciation) averaging around $6 billion the past four years. Average FCF could moderate to around $3 billion (assuming neutral working capital) over the next three years, given projected near-term EBITDA declines and assuming capex of at least $20 billion. This represents a modest step-up from the $18.5 billion average over the past four years. Capex expansion is largely for infrastructure investments to support Walmart's supply chain efficiency and automation targets in addition to store remodel efforts.\n\nReasonable Leverage; Strong Liquidity: Walmart's credit profile is supported by reasonable EBITDAR leverage, which has historically trended around 2.0x. Walmart has maintained its leverage profile through occasional debt reduction, including during 2015-2017 as EBITDA declined. Fitch's rating case assumes EBITDAR leverage to trend near or below 2.0x beginning in 2025. Walmart's reasonable leverage profile is accompanied by strong internally generated cash flow and solid liquidity, including access to a CP program partially backstopped by $15 billion of revolvers.\n\nPeer Analysis\n\nLeading U.S. physical and digital retailers within Fitch's coverage include Amazon.com, Inc. (AA-/Stable), Target Corporation (A/Negative) and The Home Depot, Inc. (A/Stable).\n\nAmazon's rating is one notch lower than Walmart's despite its similar leverage, leading positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale (with about $140 billion in 2024 EBITDA), good FCF generation and reasonable projected EBITDAR leverage of about 2.0x. Amazon's credit profile incorporates somewhat higher uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices.\n\nTarget has higher margins than Walmart, a similar leverage profile, and a smaller scale. Its market share gains during the pandemic followed successful implementation of omnichannel initiatives, and it benefits from efficient supply chain operations and differentiated customer proposition. Target's ratings reflect its higher exposure to discretionary categories such as apparel and home, which create greater levels of operating volatility through economic cycles. The Negative Outlook reflects Target's recent execution missteps, exacerbated by a volatile retail industry, which have pressured market share and profitability.\n\nHome Depot's 'A'/Stable IDR reflects its scale and cash flow generation, coupled with a solid track record of comps growth and margin expansion. Home Depot competes in the home improvement category, which has demonstrated historical operating volatility around housing and economic cycles. The ratings also reflect management's publicly stated long-term leverage target of 2.0x on an EBITDAR leverage basis.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\n--Revenue grows in the 2% to 3% range annually over the long term, largely due to positive comps, including ecommerce growth. Revenue in 2025 could decline in the low single digits due to weakness in discretionary categories;\n\n--EBITDA growth generally tracks revenue growth longer term. EBITDA in 2025 could decline close to 10%, assuming the company absorbs some tariff-related cost increases to drive market share. Margins, which have averaged high-5% range in recent years, could trend in the mid-5% range over the medium term;\n\n--FCF (adding back lease depreciation), which averaged around $6 billion annually over the past three years, averages around $3 billion beginning in 2025, assuming neutral working capital. The decline is primarily due to Fitch's projection of lower EBITDA and assumes at least $20 billion in annual capex;\n\n--EBITDAR leverage sustains around 2.0x, assuming generally stable debt levels around $40 billion;\n\n--Walmart's debt generally has fixed interest rate structures; as such, interest rate fluctuations have limited impact on its net interest expense."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\n--Weakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total EBITDAR leverage above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed shareholder friendly activity.\n\nFactors That Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\n--An upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at the high end of the rating scale and fully captures the company's financial and qualitative strengths."", 'liquidity and debt structure': ""Walmart's strong liquidity profile is bolstered by its cash balance ($9 billion as of April 30, 2025) and by its revolvers totaling $15 billion, which partially backstop Walmart's commercial paper program. As of April 30, 2025, the company had $5.6 billion of CP outstanding. Walmart's liquidity is further supported by its FCF generation, expected to average about $3 billion annually (assuming neutral working capital, adding back lease depreciation) beginning 2025. Fitch rates Walmart's CP program and unsecured notes 'F1+' and 'AA', respectively.\n\nAs of April 30, 2025, total unsecured notes outstanding was approximately $40.6 billion, including $1.5 billion notes subsequently repaid in June 2025. Approximately $1.75 billion and $3.5 billion of unsecured notes will mature in September 2025 and during 2026, respectively."", 'issuer profile': ""Walmart is a global leader in retail and e-commerce, with $681 billion of revenue in 2024 across over 10,750 stores and e-commerce websites.\n\nSummary of Financial Adjustments\n\nHistorical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock-based compensation and exclude non-recurring charges. Fitch uses the balance sheet reported lease liability as the capitalized lease value when computing lease-equivalent debt.\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\n\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\nMACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND SECTOR FORECASTS\n\nClick here: https://app.fitchconnect.com/search/research?keyword=Corporates%20Macro%20%26%20Sector%20Forecasts[https://app.fitchconnect.com/search/research?keyword=Corporates%20Macro%20%26%20Sector%20Forecasts]\n\nto access Fitch's latest quarterly Global Corporates Macro and Sector Forecasts data file which aggregates key data points used in our credit analysis.

Fitch Affirms Walmart at 'AA'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable,3328,28 June 2024,Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary,FITRA,English,"Copyright 2024 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries.","['_prologue', 'key rating drivers', 'derivation summary', 'rating sensitivities', 'liquidity and debt structure', 'issuer profile', 'esg considerations', 'contacts']","{'_prologue': ""Fitch Ratings-New York-28 June 2024: Fitch Ratings has affirmed all of Walmart, Inc.'s (Walmart) ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA' and its Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.\n\nWalmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with nearly $650 billion of revenue in 2023, positive comparable store sales (comps), and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable EBITDAR leverage around 2x. Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although near term results will be volatile due to post-pandemic consumer behavior changes and some macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nFitch expects internally generated cash flow to remain substantial, with annual FCF averaging around $2 billion after annual capex around $22 billion and dividends of approximately $6.5 billion."", 'key rating drivers': ""Massive Scale, Business Breadth: Walmart is the world's largest retailer, with nearly $650 billion revenue in 2023 across over 10,600 stores in 19 countries plus e-commerce websites. Walmart's sales mix is diverse, with just over half of revenue derived from grocery and the remainder generated from numerous general merchandise categories. The company's retail formats include discount centers, supercenters, membership clubs and smaller neighborhood markets in addition to its digital presence.\n\nLonger term, the company has identified nascent revenue streams including website/store advertising and third-party seller initiatives like marketplace opportunities and supply chain/delivery services. The company is also investing in areas such as in-store technology, customer service, and private label offerings to support topline growth in its existing business. Walmart's sizable internally generated cash flow and close customer connections enable significant investments that support market share expansion over time despite the company's size.\n\nOmnichannel Evolution Supports Market Share Defensibility: Walmart's good sales trajectory has benefited from its omnichannel expansion. The company has redirected its sizable capex, targeted around $22 billion annually, toward technology and supply chain infrastructure to improve customer-facing websites and increase distribution network flexibility.\n\nLonger-term omnichannel winners are retailers with strong physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory. Better-positioned incumbents like Walmart with good customer relationships and internally generated cash flow can strengthen their omnichannel models over time.\n\nWalmart has begun shifting its capex spend from foundational omnichannel infrastructure into investments which it believes can accelerate topline growth through better customer experience and improve margins through efficiency. The company is using data analytics and automation to optimize inventory forecasting and flow, improve supply chain speed and efficiency, and refocus labor efforts toward customer-facing activities. The company is also adding features designed to improve customer service like self-checkout models and simplified store pickup operations.\n\nInternational Portfolio Activity Supports Long Term Sales Growth: Internationally (18% of 2023 revenue), Walmart has increased its focus on China and India, markets with above-average growth potential. In 2018, the company acquired a 77% stake in leading Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart for $16 billion - its current stake is 85% following additional investment - and in 2017 formed a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce player JD.com, Inc. in which it owns 9.4%. The company's other material international presence includes its 71% stake in Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V., which generated $50 billion in 2023 revenue, and Canada, which generated $23 billion in 2023 revenue.\n\nStable Longer-Term Operating Results: Beginning 2017, Walmart has seen good growth in U.S. comparable store sales (comps), which have led to EBITDA expansion over time. Longer term Fitch expects Walmart can grow revenue and EBITDA 2% to 3% annually, with some upside possible if the company's automation and other omnichannel initiatives yield material upside.\n\nThis compares with Walmart's target of growing annual revenue 4% longer term, largely through positive comps with some contribution from ancillary businesses and modest new unit expansion, and growing annual EBITDA 4% to 8%. Fitch's projections recognize ongoing competition across Walmart's merchandise categories and the need for continuous efforts to invest in service and value initiatives.\n\nWalmart's cash flow generation is strong, with FCF after dividends averaging around $9 billion the past four years. FCF could moderate to around $2 billion (assuming neutral working capital) beginning 2024 given a step-up in capex to $22 billion from the $15 billion average over the past four years. Capex expansion, including nearly $21 billion spent in 2023, is largely been due to infrastructure investments to support Walmart's supply chain efficiency and automation targets in addition to store remodel efforts.\n\nReasonable Leverage Supported by Strong Liquidity: Walmart's credit profile is supported by reasonable EBITDAR leverage, which has historically trended around 2.0x. Walmart has maintained its leverage profile through occasional debt reduction, including during 2015-2017 as EBITDA declined. EBITDAR leverage is expected to trend near 2.0x beginning 2024.\n\nWalmart's reasonable leverage profile is accompanied by strong internally generated cash flow and solid liquidity, including access to a CP program partially backstopped by $15 billion of revolvers."", 'derivation summary': ""Walmart's 'AA' Long-Term IDR reflects its dominant global retail market share position, with close to $650 billion of revenue, positive comps, substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable EBITDAR leverage around 2x.\n\nFitch projects organic annual revenue and EBITDA growth in the low-single-digit range over time, with FCF projected to average around $2 billion.\n\nLeading U.S. physical and digital retailers within Fitch's coverage include Amazon.com (Amazon; AA-/Stable), Target Corporation (Target; A/Stable) and The Home Depot, Inc. (Home Depot; A/Stable).\n\nAmazon's rating is one notch lower than Walmart's despite similar leverage, its leading positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with approximately $103 billion in 2023 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable EBITDAR leverage expected to trend near 2.0x. Relative to Walmart, Amazon's credit profile incorporates somewhat higher uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices.\n\nTarget's ratings relative to Walmart consider its higher margins, historically similar leverage profile, smaller scale, and recent market share gains following successful implementation of omnichannel initiatives, efficient supply chain operations, and differentiated customer proposition. The ratings reflect Target's higher exposure to discretionary categories like apparel and home, which create greater levels of operating volatility through economic cycles.\n\nHome Depot's 'A'/Stable ratings reflect its scale and cash flow generation, coupled with a solid track record of comps growth and margin expansion. Home Depot competes in the home improvement category, which has demonstrated historical operating volatility around housing and economic cycles. The ratings also reflect management's publicly stated long-term leverage target of 2.0x on an EBITDAR leverage basis.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\n--Revenue is expected to grow in the 2% to 3% range annually over the long term, largely due to positive comps, including ecommerce growth. Revenue growth in 2024 could be closer to 4%-5% given a 53rd week of operations, with 2025 revenue modestly negative given the loss of the extra week;\n\n--EBITDA growth is generally expected to track with revenue growth. Margins, which have been in the 5.7%-5.8% range over the past two years, could trend in the high 5% range over the medium term as the company continues to invest in topline initiatives;\n\n--FCF, which averaged around $5 billion annually over the past three years, is expected to average around $2 billion beginning 2024, assuming neutral working capital. This assumes capex, which averaged $17 billion over the past three years, accelerates to $22 billion beginning 2024;\n\n--Fitch expects EBITDAR leverage to sustain around 2.0x, assuming generally stable debt levels around $40 billion;\n\n--Walmart's debt generally has fixed interest rate structures; as such, the recent rise in interest rates is expected to have limited impact on Walmart's interest expense but could support modest growth in interest income."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\n--An upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at the high end of the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial and qualitative strengths.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\n--Weakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total EBITDAR leverage (capitalizing leases at 8x) above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed shareholder friendly activity."", 'liquidity and debt structure': ""Significant Liquidity: Walmart's strong liquidity profile is bolstered by its cash balance ($9.4 billion as of April 30, 2024) and by its revolvers totaling $15 billion, which partially backstop Walmart's commercial paper program. As of April 30, 2024, the company had $5.5 billion of CP outstanding. Walmart's liquidity is further supported by its FCF generation, expected to average in the $2 billion range annually (assuming neutral working capital) beginning 2024.\n\nAs of April 30, 2024, total unsecured notes outstanding was approximately $38 billion after the repayment of $1.5 billion of unsecured notes due April 2024. Walmart's next maturities include $1.2 billion maturing in July 2024, $630 million maturing December 2024 and $2.6 billion maturing in 2025. Fitch expects Walmart to refinance its upcoming maturities."", 'issuer profile': ""Walmart is a global leader in retail and e-commerce, with $648 billion of revenue in 2023 across over 10,600 stores and e-commerce websites.\n\nSummary of Financial Adjustments\n\nFitch treats interest on lease liabilities and amortization of lease assets as operating costs in accordance with its lease criteria and capitalizes operating lease expense at a multiple of 8.0x.\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\n\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\nMACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND SECTOR FORECASTS\n\nClick here: https://app.fitchconnect.com/search/research?keyword=Corporates%20Macro%20%26%20Sector%20Forecasts[https://app.fitchconnect.com/search/research?keyword=Corporates%20Macro%20%26%20Sector%20Forecasts]\n\nto access Fitch's latest quarterly Global Corporates Macro and Sector Forecasts data file which aggregates key data points used in our credit analysis.

Fitch Affirms Walmart at 'AA'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable,3460,20 June 2023,Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary,FITRA,English,"Copyright 2023 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries.","['_prologue', 'key rating drivers', 'derivation summary', 'rating sensitivities', 'liquidity and debt structure', 'issuer profile', 'esg considerations', 'contacts']","{'_prologue': ""Fitch Ratings-New York-20 June 2023: Fitch Ratings has affirmed all of Walmart, Inc.'s ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA' and its Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.\n\nWalmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with over $600 billion of revenue in 2022, positive comparable store sales (comps), and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable EBITDAR leverage around 2x. Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although near term results will be volatile due to post-pandemic consumer behavior changes and some macroeconomic uncertainty. Fitch expects internally generated cash flow to remain substantial, with annual FCF averaging around $2 billion after annual capex around $17 billion and dividends of approximately $6.5 billion."", 'key rating drivers': ""Near Term Volatility Following Operating Strength: After two strong years, Walmart's 2022 (fiscal 2023) operating results were volatile given some pullback in consumer spending on goods, industry-wide excess inventory levels causing unplanned markdowns, and inflation in product costs and supply chain expenses. Walmart's 2022 EBITDA was $33.8 billion, around 6% below 2021 despite 7% sales growth. EBITDA margins fell to mid-5%, relative to the low-6% range in 2021 and pre-pandemic 2019.\n\nWhile Fitch is not forecasting a near-term consumer recession, it expects softening goods spending in the near term, particularly in discretionary goods like apparel and home. Walmart could benefit from trade-down activity given its low-price positioning, but could also experience headwinds from consumers trading down to even lower priced competitors like hard discounters and dollar stores. Fitch expects sales in 2023 and 2024 could trend near $600 billion compared with $611 billion in 2022, with modest EBITDA declines from 2022 levels assuming margins trend in the mid-5% range.\n\nFitch forecasts in the longer term that Walmart can grow revenue and EBITDA in the low single digits and expects that any temporary consumer spending dislocation could provide longer-term market share opportunities for leaders like Walmart.\n\nMassive Scale, FCF Generation, Business Breadth: Walmart is the world's largest retailer, with around $611 billion revenue in 2022 across over 10,600 stores in 20 countries plus e-commerce websites. Walmart's sales mix is diverse, with just over half of revenue derived from grocery and the remainder generated from numerous general merchandise categories. The company's retail formats include discount centers, supercenters, membership clubs and smaller neighborhood markets in addition to its digital presence.\n\nLonger term, the company has identified nascent revenue streams including website/store advertising and third-party seller initiatives like marketplace opportunities and supply chain/delivery services. Walmart's sizable internally generated cash flow and close customer connections enable market share expansion over time despite the company's size.\n\nOmnichannel Evolution Supports Market Share Defensibility: Walmart's good sales trajectory has benefited from its omnichannel expansion. The company has redirected its sizable capex, targeted around $17 billion annually, toward technology and supply chain infrastructure to improve customer-facing websites and increase distribution network flexibility.\n\nLonger-term omnichannel winners are retailers with strong physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory. Better-positioned incumbents like Walmart with good customer relationships and internally generated cash flow can strengthen their omnichannel models over time.\n\nWalmart has begun shifting its capex spend from foundational omnichannel infrastructure into investments which it believes can accelerate topline growth through better customer experience and improve margins through efficiency. The company is using data analytics and automation to optimize inventory forecasting and flow, improve supply chain speed and efficiency, and refocus labor efforts toward customer-facing activities. The company is also adding features designed to improve customer service like self-checkout models and simplified store pickup operations.\n\nInternational Portfolio Activity Supports Long Term Sales Growth: Internationally (17% of 2022 revenue), Walmart has increased its focus on China and India, markets with above-average growth potential. In 2018, the company acquired a 77% stake in leading Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart for $16 billion and in 2017 formed a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce player JD.com, Inc. in which it owns approximately 10%.\n\nWalmart's other international markets are being positioned to either provide stable cash flow or disposal opportunities. In recent years, the company has sold majority stakes in its businesses in the U.K., Japan, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nStable Longer-Term Operating Results: Beginning 2017, Walmart has seen good growth in U.S. comparable store sales (comps), which have led to EBITDA expansion over time. Longer term Fitch expects Walmart can grow revenue and EBITDA 2% to 3% annually, with some upside possible if the company's automation and other omnichannel initiatives yield material upside.\n\nWalmart's cash flow generation is strong, with FCF after dividends averaging around $9 billion the past four years. FCF could moderate to around $2 billion (assuming neutral working capital) beginning 2023 given a step-up in capex to $17 billion from the $13 billion average over the past four years.\n\nReasonable Leverage Supported by Strong FCF and Liquidity: Walmart's credit profile is supported by reasonable EBITDAR leverage, which has historically trended around 2.0x. Walmart has maintained its leverage profile through occasional debt reduction, including during 2015-2017 as EBITDA declined. EBITDAR leverage is expected to trend near 2.0x beginning 2023.\n\nWalmart's reasonable leverage profile is accompanied by strong FCF and solid liquidity, including access to a CP program partially backstopped by $15 billion of revolvers."", 'derivation summary': ""Walmart's 'AA' Long-Term IDR reflects its dominant global retail market share position, with $611 billion of revenue in 2022, positive comps, substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable EBITDAR leverage around 2x.\n\nFitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, with FCF projected to average around $2 billion.\n\nLeading U.S. physical and digital retailers within Fitch's coverage include Amazon.com (Amazon; AA-/Stable), Target Corporation (Target; A/Stable) and The Home Depot, Inc. (Home Depot; A/Stable).\n\nAmazon's rating is one notch lower than Walmart's despite similar leverage, its leading positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, close customer connections, significant scale with approximately $67 billion in 2022 EBITDA, good FCF generation and reasonable EBITDAR leverage expected to trend near 2.0x. Relative to Walmart, Amazon's credit profile incorporates somewhat higher uncertainty around its long-term operating path and ongoing regulatory activity surrounding the company's market share and business practices.\n\nTarget's ratings relative to Walmart consider its higher margins, historically similar leverage profile, smaller scale, and recent market share gains following successful implementation of omnichannel initiatives, efficient supply chain operations, and differentiated customer proposition. The ratings reflect Target's higher exposure to discretionary categories like apparel and home, which create greater levels of operating volatility through economic cycles.\n\nHome Depot's 'A'/Stable ratings reflect its scale and cash flow generation, coupled with a solid track record of comps growth and margin expansion. Home Depot competes in the home improvement category, which has demonstrated historical operating volatility around housing and economic cycles. The ratings also reflect management's publicly stated long-term leverage target of 2.0x on an EBITDAR leverage basis (capitalizing leases at 8.0x).\n\nKey Assumptions\n\nFitch's Key Assumptions Within The Rating Case for the Issuer:\n\n--Revenue is expected to decline slightly in 2023/2024 against challenging comparisons and some easing of inflation. Sales in discretionary categories like apparel and home furnishings are expected to be weaker in the near term than consumables categories like grocery. Longer term, Fitch expects low-single digit growth in revenue, largely due to positive comps, including ecommerce growth.\n\n--EBITDA margins could trend in the mid-5% range beginning 2023, close to the 5.5% in 2022, and below the historical average in the low-6% range on general cost inflation and ongoing investments in topline initiatives, including omnichannel expenses. EBITDA could therefore trend in the $33 billion range over the next two to three years, growing with topline expansion longer term.\n\n--FCF, which averaged around $10 billion annually prior to the pandemic, is expected to average around $2 billion beginning 2023, assuming neutral working capital. This assumes capex, which was historically around $10 billion before accelerating to $13 billion in 2021 and $17 billion in 2022, trends in the $17 billion range.\n\n-- Fitch expects EBITDAR leverage to sustain around 2.0x, assuming generally stable debt levels around $40 billion.\n\n--Walmart's debt generally has fixed interest rate structures; as such, the recent rise in interest rates is expected to have limited impact on Walmart's interest expense but could support modest growth in interest income."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\n--An upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at the high end of the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial and qualitative strengths.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\n--Weakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total EBITDAR leverage (capitalizing leases at 8x) above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed shareholder friendly activity.\n\nBest/Worst Case Rating Scenario\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

Walmart's liquidity is further supported by meaningful FCF generation, expected to average in the $2 billion range annually (assuming neutral working capital) beginning 2023.\n\nAs of April 30, 2023, total unsecured notes outstanding was approximately $42 billion, including $2.3 billion maturing in June 2023, $150 million maturing October 2023 and $3.4 billion maturing in 2024.

Walmart's 2022 EBITDA was $33.8 billion, around 6% below 2021 levels despite a 7% topline increase. EBITDA margins fell to mid-5%, relative to the low-6% range in 2021 and pre-pandemic 2019.\n\nWhile Fitch does not currently forecast a consumer recession, it expects spending on goods to continue to soften into 2023, particularly in discretionary goods like apparel and home. Walmart's low price positioning and exposure to lower end consumers could have a mixed impact, as the company could benefit from trade-down activity but also experience headwinds from consumers trading down to even lower priced competitors like hard discounters and dollar stores. Fitch expects sales in 2023 and 2024 could trend near $600 billion compared with $611 billion in 2022, with modest EBITDA declines from 2022 levels assuming margins trend in the mid-5% range.\n\nLonger term, Fitch forecasts Walmart can grow revenue and EBITDA low single digits and expects that any temporary consumer spending dislocation could provide longer-term market share opportunities for leaders like Walmart.\n\nMassive Scale, FCF Generation, Business Breadth: Walmart is the world's largest retailer, with around $611 billion revenue in 2022 across over 10,600 stores in 20 countries plus e-commerce websites.

Longer term, Fitch expects low-single digit growth in revenue, largely due to positive comps, including ecommerce growth.\n\n--EBITDA margins could trend in the mid-5% range beginning 2023, close to the 5.5% in 2022, and below the historical average in the low-6% range on general cost inflation and ongoing investments in topline initiatives, including omnichannel expenses. EBITDA could therefore trend in the $33 billion range over the next two to three years, growing with topline expansion longer term.\n\n--FCF, which averaged around $10 billion annually prior to the pandemic, is expected to decline to the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range beginning 2023, assuming neutral working capital. This assumes capex, which was historically around $10 billion before accelerating to $13 billion in 2021 and $17 billion in 2022, trends in the $17 billion range.\n\n--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) historically trended around 2x but moved up to 2.3x in 2018/2019 following the debt-financed investment in Flipkart, which generates operating losses. Adjusted leverage returned to the 2.0x range in 2020 and Fitch expects leverage to sustain around 2.0x beginning 2023, assuming generally stable debt levels around $40 billion."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\n--An upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at the high end of the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial and qualitative strengths.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\n--Weakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed shareholder friendly activity.\n\nBest/Worst Case Rating Scenario\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years.

Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.\n\nWalmart's 'AA'/Stable ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $588 billion of LTM July 2022 revenue, positive comparable store sales (comps), substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage around 2x. Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although near term results will be volatile due to post-pandemic consumer behavior changes, inventory clearance activity and some macroeconomic uncertainty. FCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $3 billion and $5 billion annually beginning 2022. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to trend at or below the low-2.0x range, including 2022."", 'key rating drivers': ""Potential Volatility Following Operating Strength:\n\nWalmart's near-term results will be volatile following two strong years. While Fitch is not currently forecasting a consumer recession, many retailers are facing difficult comparisons and a consumer who is incrementally less interested in purchasing goods versus services like travel and entertainment. Walmart's low price positioning and exposure to lower end consumers could have a mixed impact, as the company could benefit from trade-down activity but also experience headwinds from consumers trading down to even lower priced competitors like hard discounters and dollar stores. Walmart's increased exposure to discretionary categories like apparel and home could also represent headwinds if its customer base reduces overall spending in these categories.\n\nFitch expects revenue to grow 4% in 2022 toward $600 billion largely due to inflation but decline to around $575 billion in 2023, albeit well above the $524 billion recorded in pre-pandemic 2019. Given supply chain challenges and near-term markdown activity to address excess inventory, EBITDA could trend in the low-$30 billion range, similar to 2019, with margins in the 5% to 5.5% range compared with around 6% prior to the pandemic. Longer term, Fitch forecasts Walmart can grow revenue and EBITDA low single digits and expects that any temporary consumer spending dislocation could provide longer term market share opportunities for leaders like Walmart.\n\nMassive Scale, FCF Generation, Business Breadth:\n\nWalmart is the world's largest retailer, with over $588 billion in LTM July 2022 revenue across over 10,500 stores in 24 countries plus e-commerce websites. Walmart's sales mix is diverse, with just over half of revenue derived from grocery and the remainder generated from numerous general merchandise categories. The company's retail formats include discount centers, supercenters, membership clubs and smaller neighborhood markets in addition to its digital presence. Walmart's sizable internally generated cash flow and close customer connections enable market share expansion over time despite the company's size.\n\nOmnichannel Evolution Supports Market Share Defensibility:\n\nWalmart's recent sales trajectory has benefited from its omnichannel expansion. The company has redirected its sizable capex, targeted around $14 billion annually, toward technology and supply chain infrastructure to improve customer-facing websites and increase distribution network flexibility. Longer term omnichannel winners are retailers with a good portfolio of physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory.\n\nThese models are expensive to build and maintain, particularly in grocery, where distribution expenses and logistical complexity have kept digital penetration low. Better-positioned incumbents like Walmart with good customer relationships and internally generated cash flow can strengthen their omnichannel models over time.\n\nInternational Portfolio Activity Supports Long Term Sales Growth:\n\nInternationally, Walmart has increased focus on China and India, two markets with above-average growth potential. In 2018, the company acquired a 77% stake in leading Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart for $16 billion and in 2017 formed a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce player JD.com, Inc. in which it owns approximately 10%.\n\nWalmart's other international markets are being positioned to either provide stable cash flow or disposal opportunities. Over the past three years, the company has sold majority stakes in its businesses in the U.K., Japan, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nStable Longer-Term Operating Results:\n\nWalmart's operational initiatives have borne fruit with annual U.S. comps averaging 2.8% during the three years ending 2019, before accelerating to 8.6% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2021. Digital U.S. growth was 37% in pre-pandemic 2019 but was 79% and 11% in 2020 and 2021, respectively, given changes to consumer behavior and good omnichannel execution.\n\nEBITDA growth has followed topline growth in recent years, with margins generally trending in the low-6% range (2020 was 5.9%, largely due to heightened coronavirus-related operating expenses); EBITDA was approximately $36 billion in 2021.\n\nWalmart's cash flow generation is strong, with FCF after dividends averaging around $10 billion the past four years. FCF could moderate toward the $3 billion to $5 billion range (assuming neutral working capital) beginning 2022 given a step-up in capex to $14 billion from the $10 billion range prior to 2021.\n\nReasonable Leverage Supported by Strong FCF and Liquidity:\n\nWalmart's credit profile is supported by reasonable adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x), which has historically trended around 2.0x. Walmart has maintained its leverage profile through occasional debt reduction, including during 2015-2017 as EBITDA declined, and Fitch would expect the company to maintain this discipline should current challenges persist.

EBITDA margins in 2022 are expected to be pressured by excess markdowns as the company addresses an excess inventory position, particularly in categories like apparel and home. EBITDA could therefore trend in the low $30 billion range over the next two to three years, below the $36 billion recorded in 2021 but close to pre-pandemic averages.\n\n--FCF, which averaged around $10 billion annually prior to the pandemic, is expected to decline but remain robust in the $3 billion to $5 billion range beginning 2022, assuming neutral working capital.

The Rating Outlook is Stable.\n\nWalmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $573 billion of 2021 (ended January 2022) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comps), substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage around 2x.\n\nFitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although near-term results will be volatile due to post-pandemic consumer behavior changes, inventory clearance activity and some macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nFCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $3 billion and $5 billion annually beginning 2022. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to trend at or below the low-2.0x range, including 2022."", 'key rating drivers': ""Potential Volatility Following Operating Strength: Walmart's near-term results will be volatile following a strong 2020/2021 period. While Fitch is not currently forecasting a consumer recession, many retailers are facing difficult comparisons and a consumer who is incrementally less interested in purchasing goods versus services like travel and entertainment.\n\nWalmart's low price positioning and exposure to lower end consumers could have a mixed impact, as the company could benefit from trade-down activity to Walmart, but also experience headwinds from consumers trading down to even lower priced competitors like hard discounters and dollar stores. Walmart's increased exposure to discretionary categories like apparel and home could also represent headwinds if its customer base reduces overall spending in these categories.\n\nFitch expects revenue to grow 4% in 2022 toward $600 billion largely due to inflation, but decline to around $575 billion in 2023, albeit well above the $524 billion recorded in pre-pandemic 2019. Given supply chain challenges and near-term markdown activity to address excess inventory, EBITDA could trend in the low-$30 billion range, similar to 2019, with margins in the 5.0% to 5.5% range compared with around 6% prior to the pandemic. Longer term, Fitch forecasts Walmart can grow revenue and EBITDA in the low single digits and expects that any temporary consumer spending dislocation could provide longer term market share opportunities for leaders like Walmart.\n\nMassive Scale, FCF Generation, Business Breadth: Walmart is the world's largest retailer, with over $570 billion in LTM April 2022 revenue across over 10,500 stores in 24 countries plus e-commerce websites. Walmart's sales mix is diverse, with just over half of revenue derived from grocery and the remainder generated from numerous general merchandise categories. The company's retail formats include discount centers, supercenters, membership clubs and smaller neighborhood markets in addition to its digital presence. Walmart's sizable internally generated cash flow and close customer connections enable market share expansion over time despite the company's size.\n\nOmnichannel Evolution Supports Market Share Defensibility: Walmart's recent sales trajectory has benefited from its omnichannel expansion. The company has redirected its sizable capex, targeted at around $14 billion annually, toward technology and supply chain infrastructure to improve customer-facing websites and increase distribution network flexibility.\n\nLonger-term omnichannel winners are retailers with a good portfolio of physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory. These models are expensive to build and maintain, particularly in grocery, where distribution expenses and logistical complexity have kept digital penetration low. Better-positioned incumbents like Walmart with good customer relationships and internally generated cash flow can strengthen their omnichannel models over time.\n\nInternational Portfolio Activity Supports Long Term Sales Growth: Internationally, Walmart has increased its focus on China and India, two markets with above-average growth potential. In 2018, the company acquired a 77% stake in leading Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart for $16 billion and in 2017 formed a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce player JD.com, Inc. in which it owns approximately 10%.\n\nWalmart's other international markets are being positioned to either provide stable cash flow or disposal opportunities. Over the past three years, the company has sold majority stakes in its businesses in the U.K., Japan, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nStable Longer-Term Operating Results: Walmart's operational initiatives have borne fruit with annual U.S. comps averaging 2.8% during the three years ending 2019, before accelerating to 8.6% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2021. Digital U.S. growth was 37% in pre-pandemic 2019, but was 79% and 11% in 2020 and 2021, respectively, given changes to consumer behavior and good omnichannel execution.\n\nEBITDA growth has followed topline growth in recent years, with margins generally trending in the low-6% range (2020 was 5.9%, largely due to heightened coronavirus-related operating expenses); EBITDA was approximately $36 billion in 2021.\n\nWalmart's cash flow generation is strong, with FCF after dividends averaging around $10 billion the past four years. FCF could moderate toward the $3 billion to $5 billion range (assuming neutral working capital) beginning 2022 given a step-up in capex to $14 billion from the $10 billion range prior to 2021.\n\nReasonable Leverage Supported by Strong FCF and Liquidity: Walmart's credit profile is supported by reasonable adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x), which has historically trended around 2.0x. Walmart has maintained its leverage profile through occasional debt reduction, including during 2015-2017 as EBITDA declined and Fitch would expect the company to maintain this discipline should current challenges persist. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend near 2.0x beginning 2022.\n\nWalmart's reasonable leverage profile is accompanied by strong FCF and solid liquidity, including access to a commercial paper program partially backstopped by $15 billion of revolvers."", 'derivation summary': ""Walmart's 'AA' Long-Term IDR reflects its dominant global retail market share position, with $573 billion of 2021 (ended January 2022) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comps), substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage around 2x.\n\nFitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although near-term results will be volatile due to post-pandemic consumer behavior changes, inventory clearance activity and some macroeconomic uncertainty. FCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $3 billion and $5 billion annually beginning 2022. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to trend at or below the low-2.0x range over time.\n\nLeading U.S. physical and digital retailers within Fitch's coverage include Amazon.com (AA-/Stable), The Home Depot, Inc. (A/Stable) and Target Corporation (A/Stable).\n\nAmazon's rating is one notch lower than Walmart's despite similar leverage, its leading positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, higher margins, and strong FCF generation due mainly to Walmart's larger scale and more consistent historical leverage profile. Target's ratings relative to Walmart consider its higher margins, historically similar leverage profile, smaller scale, and recent market share gains following successful implementation of omnichannel initiatives, efficient supply chain operations, and differentiated customer proposition.\n\nHome Depot's rating reflects its leading position in the home improvement industry, which benefits from limited online and discount incursion although is highly cyclical alongside housing market activity; Home Depot's adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to be approximately 2.0x.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\nFitch's Key Assumptions Within the Rating Case for the Issuer\n\n--Revenue is expected to be up around 4% in 2022, largely due to consumer price inflation, and decline in the 3% range in 2023 against challenging comparisons and some easing of inflation. Longer term, Fitch expects low-single digit growth in revenue, largely due to positive comps, including ecommerce growth.\n\n--EBITDA margins could trend in the low- to mid-5% range beginning 2022, below the recent average in the low-6% range on general cost inflation and ongoing investments in topline initiatives, including omnichannel expenses. EBITDA margins in 2022 are expected to be pressured by excess markdowns as the company addresses an excess inventory position, particularly in categories like apparel and home. EBITDA could therefore trend in the low $30 billion range over the next two to three years, below the $36 billion recorded in 2021, but close to pre-pandemic averages.\n\n--FCF, which averaged around $10 billion annually prior to the pandemic, is expected to decline but remain robust in the $3 billion to $5 billion range beginning 2022, assuming neutral working capital. This assumes capex, which was historically around $10 billion, trends in the $14 billion range.\n\n--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) historically trended around 2x but moved up to 2.3x in 2018/2019 following the debt-financed investment in Flipkart, which generates operating losses. Adjusted leverage returned to the 2.0x range in 2020 and Fitch expects leverage to sustain around 2.0x beginning 2022, assuming generally stable debt levels around $38 billion."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\n--An upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at the high end of the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial and qualitative strengths.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\n--Weakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed shareholder friendly activity.\n\nBest/Worst Case Rating Scenario\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

Walmart's liquidity is further supported by meaningful FCF generation, expected to average in the $3 billion to $5 billion range annually (assuming neutral working capital) beginning in 2022.\n\nAt the end of 2021, total debt outstanding was approximately $38.3 billion. Approximately $1.6 billion of unsecured notes have matured thus far in 2022 with another $1.25 billion notes maturity in December 2022; approximately $4.2 billion of debt matures in 2023."", 'issuer profile': ""Walmart is a global leader in retail and e-commerce, with over $576 billion in trailing twelve month (April 2022) revenue across over 10,500 stores and e-commerce websites.\n\nSummary of Financial Adjustments\n\nFitch treats interest on lease liabilities and amortization of lease assets as operating costs in accordance with Fitch's lease criteria and capitalizes operating lease expense at a multiple of 8.0x.\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\n\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria."", 'esg considerations': ""Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

Proceeds, along with cash on hand, is expected to be used for early redemption of up to $8 billion in existing debt. While the transaction is modestly deleveraging, Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing lease expense at 8.0x) to trend near 2.0x over time.\n\nWalmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $559 billion of 2020 (ended January 2021) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comps), substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage around 2.0x. Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although results are likely to remain somewhat volatile in the near term due to changing consumer behavior resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. FCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $6 billion and $8 billion annually beginning 2022. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to trend near 2.0x over time assuming flattish debt levels following this transaction."", 'key rating drivers': ""Coronavirus Pandemic:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic meaningfully impacted U.S. retailer operating trajectories beginning March 2020. Most retail categories benefitted from changes to consumer behavior such as more time and meals spent at home, discretionary budget savings from reduced spending on services, and government stimulus payments. General merchants and superstores saw additional benefits from shopping trip consolidation.\n\nWalmart's 2020 U.S. comp grew 8.6%, supported by these tailwinds in addition to Walmart's leading omnichannel capabilities, including in-store and curbside pickup of online orders. Strong sales led to similar EBITDA growth on a comparable basis despite mix shifts toward lower-margin grocery items and heightened operating expenses. Walmart's 1Q21 and 2Q21 U.S. comp remained strong at 6.0% and 5.5% respectively. Although revenue growth could turn negative in 2H21 as consumers reset budgets toward services, and against a challenging 2020 comparison, potential EBITDA declines in 2021 could be limited due to the unwinding of margin and expense impacts from 2020. Revenue and EBITDA growth is expected to return to low-single digits beginning 2022.\n\nWalmart should benefit longer term from several implications of the coronavirus pandemic. First, the pandemic has accelerated retail real estate retrenchment. Square footage rationalization will improve the retail supply/demand balance. Second, the pandemic has proven a watershed moment for omnichannel models, particularly in lower-online penetration categories like grocery. Walmart's 2020 U.S. digital business grew 79% to over $65 billion or approximately 12% of revenue and the company is the second largest U.S. digital general merchant behind Amazon.com.\n\nMassive Scale, FCF Generation, Business Breadth:\n\nWalmart is the world's largest retailer, with over $550 billion in projected 2021 annual revenue across over 11,400 stores in over 25 countries plus e-commerce websites. Walmart's sizable internally generated cash flow and close customer connections enable market share expansion over time.\n\nOmnichannel Evolution Supports Market Share Defensibility:\n\nWalmart's recent sales trajectory has benefited from its omnichannel expansion. The company has redirected its sizable capex, targeted around $14 billion beginning 2021, toward technology and supply chain infrastructure to improve customer-facing websites and increase distribution network flexibility. Longer term omnichannel winners are retailers with a good portfolio of physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory. These models are expensive to build and maintain, particularly in grocery, where distribution expenses and logistical complexity have kept digital penetration low. Better-positioned incumbents like Walmart with good customer relationships and internally generated cash flow can strengthen their omnichannel models over time.\n\nStable Operating Results:\n\nWalmart's efforts have borne fruit with annual U.S. comps averaging 2.8% during the three years ending 2019, before accelerating to 8.6% in 2020. Digital growth was 37% and 79% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Fitch expects normalized U.S. comps can grow at least 2% annually over the long term.\n\nGood topline results supported EBITDA stabilization beginning 2017 following several years of EBITDA declines on increased growth investments and hourly wage increases. Fitch-defined EBITDA expanded to $33.2 billion in 2020 from $32.4 billion in 2019, despite an approximately negative $1.5 billion impact from Fitch's EBITDA methodology change which factors capital lease amortization as rent. Revenue and EBITDA are expected to grow low single digits over the medium term.\n\nWalmart's cash flow generation is strong, with FCF after dividends averaging over $12 billion the past four years. FCF in 2020 was $19 billion on working capital swings, which could somewhat reverse in 2021, yielding modestly positive FCF of around $3 billion. FCF could improve to $6 billion to $8 billion beginning 2022, somewhat below prepandemic levels assuming capex remains near $14 billion.\n\nInternational Portfolio Activity Supports Long Term Sales Growth:\n\nInternationally, Walmart has increased focus on China and India, two markets with above-average growth potential. In 2018, the company acquired a 77% stake in leading Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart for $16 billion and in 2017 formed a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce player JD.com, Inc. in which it owns approximately 10%.\n\nWalmart's other international markets are being positioned to either provide stable cash flow or disposal opportunities. Over the past three years, the company has sold majority stakes in its businesses in the U.K., Japan, Argentina and Brazil.\n\nReasonable Leverage Supported by Strong FCF and Liquidity:\n\nWalmart's credit profile is supported by reasonable adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8.0x), which has historically trended around 2.0x. Walmart has maintained its leverage profile through debt reduction, including the net repayment of over $6 billion of debt in 2019/2020. Adjusted leverage is expected to trend near 2.0x beginning 2021.\n\nWalmart's reasonable leverage profile is accompanied by strong FCF and solid liquidity, including access to a commercial paper program partially backstopped by $15 billion of revolving credit facilities."", 'derivation summary': ""Walmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $559 billion of 2020 (ended January 2021) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comps), substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage around 2.0x over time. Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although results are likely to remain somewhat volatile in the near term due to changing consumer behavior resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. FCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $6 billion and $8 billion annually beginning 2022. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to trend near 2.0x range over time.\n\nLeading U.S. physical and digital retailers within Fitch's coverage include Amazon.com (AA-/Stable), The Home Depot, Inc. (A/Stable) and Target Corporation (A/Stable).\n\nAmazon's rating is one notch lower than Walmart's despite similar leverage, its leading positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, higher margins, and strong FCF generation due largely to Walmart's larger scale and more consistent historical leverage profile. Home Depot's rating reflects its leading position in the home improvement industry, which benefits from limited online and discount incursion although is highly cyclical alongside housing market activity; Home Depot's adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to be approximately 2.0x. Target's ratings relative to Walmart consider its higher margins, historically similar leverage profile, smaller scale, and longer term history of inconsistent comp performance, partially due to its higher price perception and exposure to discretionary categories which are both more cyclical and more exposed to online incursion.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\nFitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer\n\n--Revenue is expected to decline around 1% in 2021 as Walmart compares against 7% growth from 2020, which benefitted from changes to consumer behavior including higher grocery expenditures. Beginning 2022, Fitch expects low-single digit growth in revenue, largely due to positive comps, including ecommerce growth;\n\n--EBITDA margins could modestly expand from 5.9% in 2020 toward historical levels in the low to mid 6% range over the next three years on merchandise shifts away from lower-margin grocery products as well as abating pandemic-related expenses like employee bonuses and store cleaning;\n\n--EBITDA in 2021 could be close to the $35 billion level as revenue declines are mitigated by improved margins. Beginning 2022, Fitch expects EBITDA to grow modestly alongside topline expansion in the low single digits;\n\n--FCF, which improved from prior averages of around $10 billion to $19 billion in 2020 on working capital benefits, could be modestly positive in 2021 assuming working capital benefits reverse. FCF is also negatively impacted by Walmart's decision to accelerate capex spending to $14 billion from the recent $10 billion range to support supply chain and other initiatives. FCF could be in the $6 billion to $8 billion range beginning 2022, assuming neutral working capital and steady capex around $14 billion."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\n--An upgrade is unlikely, given the 'AA' rating is currently at the high end of the rating spectrum for retailers and fully captures the company's longstanding financial policy and qualitative strengths.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\n--Weakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8.0x) sustained above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed acquisition or shareholder friendly activity.\n\nBest/Worst Case Rating Scenario\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

During 1Q21, the company renewed both its 364-day, $10 billion revolving credit facility and its five-year, $5 billion revolving credit facility. Walmart's liquidity is further supported by meaningful FCF generation, expected to average in the $6 billion to $8 billion range annually beginning 2022.\n\nAt the end of 2020, total debt outstanding was approximately $44.5 billion. YTD July 31, 2021, $3 billion of unsecured notes matured and were repaid with cash. Following the expected $5 billion note issuance and $8 billion tender, total debt is expected at around $38.5 billion."", 'issuer profile': ""Walmart is a global leader in retail and e-commerce, with over $560 billion in trailing 12-month (July 2021) revenue across well over 11,000 stores and e-commerce websites.\n\nSummary of Financial Adjustments\n\nFitch treats interest on lease liabilities and amortization of lease assets as operating costs in accordance with Fitch's lease criteria and capitalizes operating lease expense at a multiple of 8.0x. Additionally, Fitch adjusts for restructuring expense which totaled $380 million in 2020.\n\nDate of Relevant Committee\n\n04 June 2021\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\n\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria."", 'esg considerations': ""Unless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3'.

Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth over time, although results are likely to remain somewhat volatile in the near term due to changing consumer behaviour resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. FCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $5 billion and $7 billion annually beginning 2022. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to trend in the low-2.0x range over time.\n\nLeading U.S. physical and digital retailers within Fitch's coverage include Amazon.com (AA-/Stable), The Home Depot, Inc. (A/Stable) and Target Corporation (A/Stable).\n\nAmazon's rating is one notch lower than Walmart's despite similar leverage, its leading positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, higher margins, and strong FCF generation due largely to Walmart's larger scale and more consistent historical leverage profile. Home Depot's rating reflects its leading position in the home improvement industry, which benefits from limited online and discount incursion although is highly cyclical alongside housing market activity; Home Depot's adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to be approximately 2.0x. Target's ratings relative to Walmart consider its higher margins, historically similar leverage profile, smaller scale, and longer term history of inconsistent comp performance, partially due to its higher price perception and exposure to discretionary categories which are both more cyclical and more exposed to online incursion.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\nFitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer\n\n-- Revenue is expected to decline around 3% in 2021 as Walmart compares against 7% growth from 2020, which benefitted from changes to consumer behavior including higher grocery expenditures. Beginning 2022, Fitch expects low-single digit growth in revenue, largely due to positive comps, including ecommerce growth.\n\n-- EBITDA margins could modestly expand from 5.9% in 2020 over the next three years on merchandise shifts away from lower-margin grocery products as well as abating pandemic-related expenses like employee bonuses and store cleaning.\n\n--EBITDA in 2021 could be close to the $32 billion level from 2020 as revenue declines are mitigated by improved margins. Beginning 2022, Fitch expects EBITDA to grow modestly alongside topline expansion.\n\n--FCF, which improved from prior averages of around $10 billion to $19 billion in 2020 on working capital benefits, could be modestly positive in 2021 assuming working capital benefits reverse. FCF is also negatively impacted by Walmart's decision to accelerate capex spending to $14 billion from the recent $10 billion range to support supply chain and other initiatives. FCF could be in the $5 billion to $7 billion range beginning 2022, assuming neutral working capital and steady capex around $14 billion.\n\n--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) historically trended around 2x but moved up to 2.3x in 2018 following the debt-financed investment in Flipkart, which generates operating losses. Fitch expects leverage to sustain in the low-2.0x beginning 2021 assuming modest EBITDA growth and generally stable debt levels."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\nAn upgrade is unlikely, given the AA rating is currently at the high end of the rating spectrum for retailers and fully captures the company's longstanding financial policy and qualitative strengths.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\n--Weakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8.0x) sustained above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed acquisition or shareholder friendly activity.\n\nBest/Worst Case Rating Scenario\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years.

Walmart's liquidity is further supported by meaningful FCF generation, expected to average in the $5 billion to $7 billion range annually beginning 2022.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the total debt outstanding was approximately $44.5 billion. Unsecured notes totaling $3 billion mature in 2021, of which $0.5 billion matured in 1Q21 and was repaid with cash on hand.

Fitch Affirms Walmart at 'AA'/'F1+'; Outlook Stable,4816,16 July 2020,Fitch Rating / Non Rating Action Commentary,FITRA,English,"Copyright 2020 by Fitch Ratings Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries.","['_prologue', 'key rating drivers', 'derivation summary', 'rating sensitivities', 'liquidity and debt structure', 'esg considerations', 'contacts', 'applicable criteria']","{'_prologue': ""Fitch Ratings-New York-16 July 2020: Fitch has affirmed its ratings on Walmart Inc., including its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA' and Short-Term Rating at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.\n\nWalmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with $524 billion of 2019 (ended January 2020) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage around 2x over time. Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth beginning 2021. EBITDA is expected to decline modestly in 2020 due to the impact of higher store-level expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic on higher top line growth of around 5%. FCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion annually over the next several years. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to trend in the low-2.0x range over time, although leverage could remain temporarily elevated at around 2.4x in 2020 due to increased operating expenses related to the coronavirus pandemic."", 'key rating drivers': ""Massive Scale, FCF Generation, Business Breadth\n\nWalmart's ratings reflect its dominant position as the world's largest retailer, with top-tier positions across markets and categories globally. The company generates over $520 billion in annual revenue across over 11,500 stores in 27 countries plus e-commerce websites. Walmart's sizable internally generated cash flow ($25 billion in 2019 prior to capex and dividends) and close customer connections allow it to maintain and grow market share in existing categories and markets while investing in future growth opportunities. For example, in recent years the company has invested at least $10 billion of annual capex into its business, with around half in 2019 focused on omnichannel investments.\n\nWalmart generates approximately 75% of revenue in the U.S. through nearly 5,400 stores but is geographically diverse with significant presence in major markets like Mexico (over 2,500 stores), the U.K. (over 600 stores), China (over 400 stores), Canada (over 400 stores) and Chile (nearly 400 stores). While grocery constitutes around half of Walmart's topline, the company's broad segment exposure includes most retail categories and a number of consumer-oriented services. Walmart's breadth of formats include discount stores, supercenters, warehouse clubs (primarily under the Sam's Club banner) and grocery-focused markets; Fitch estimates Walmart's fast-growing e-commerce business generates around 7% to 8% of sales and could be around 10% in 2020.\n\nCoronavirus Pandemic - Near-Term Impact\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused significant changes to both near-term U.S. consumer behavior and Fitch's expectations around U.S. retail sales through the next 12 to 18 months. Since shelter in place activity began in March, staples retailers like Walmart have seen sales uplift as consumers purchase essential general merchandise items; grocery sales have been particularly strong given restaurant closures. Revenue growth in these categories has been partially offset by soft trends in discretionary categories like home and apparel. Retailers which have experienced topline uplifts have also seen operating expense growth, due largely to higher employee wages and 'hero' bonuses as well as enhanced cleaning expense. Some retailers, including Walmart, have also seen expense growth from increased online order penetration, which yields incremental delivery expense or labor in the case of in-store pickup of online orders.\n\nFitch expects many of the above trends to persist through 2020, although moderate as restaurants open and grocery strength subsides, and as some near term expenses such as employee bonuses end. In 2020, Fitch expects Walmart's topline to expand around 5% to nearly $550 billion, although EBITDA is expected to modestly decline to the $29.6 billion range from $31.6 billion in 2019 on higher expenses and mix shifts toward lower-margin categories. Approximately, $1.5 billion of the decline is due to Fitch's change in treatment of capital leases, which includes ongoing expenses including amortization as rent. Revenue in 2021 could moderate slightly toward $540 billion on difficult grocery comparisons, mitigated somewhat by lapping weak trends in discretionary categories. Fitch is currently forecasting a consumer spending downturn through much of 2021, but Walmart is expected to be relatively immune to broader consumer spending concerns given its low mix of discretionary categories and low-price positioning. EBITDA is expected to improve toward the low $31 billion range on improved merchandise mix shifts and reduced pandemic-related operating expenses. Revenue and EBITDA are expected to resume low-single digit growth in 2022.\n\nWalmart has ample liquidity with which to manage through the current environment. The company had approximately $15 billion in cash as of April 30, 2020, in addition to access to a commercial paper program, which is partially backstopped by $15 billion in revolving credit facilities. Availability on these credit facilities was reduced by approximately $4 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of April 30, 2020. The company generated approximately $3.8 billion in 1Q 2020 FCF after $1.5 billion in dividends, and Fitch expects the company could generate FCF in 2020 of around $7 billion, compared with 2019 results of approximately $8 billion. While Fitch has assumed that FCF would be diverted towards share buybacks, the company could choose to pay down commercial paper or upcoming debt maturities.\n\nCoronavirus Pandemic - Long-Term Implication\n\nFitch expects Walmart to benefit longer-term from several implications of the coronavirus pandemic and consumer spending downturn. First, the pandemic has accelerated real estate retrenchment, defaults, and liquidations from weaker players. Stronger players are similarly reconsidering real estate expansion plans and some may pare existing store count. An expected rationalization of retail square footage across a number of categories will improve the retail supply/demand balance, allowing strong competitors like Walmart to consolidate and grow share over time.\n\nSecond, Fitch expects the pandemic to prove a watershed moment for consumer acceptance of omnichannel models, including store pickup of online orders, particularly in lower-online penetration categories like grocery. For example, Walmart's U.S. business saw a 74% increase in e-commerce sales in 1Q 2020. Longer term omnichannel winners are those retailers with a good portfolio of physical assets, including store network and distribution facilities, robust customer-facing websites, and good data collection and analytical capabilities around consumer behavior and inventory. These models are capital intensive to build and typically lower margin than store operations. This is particularly true within grocery, where distribution expenses and logistical complexity have kept penetration low. As a result, better positioned incumbents like Walmart with good customer relationships and the ability to invest internally generated cash flow should be able to strengthen their omnichannel models and market share over time.\n\nOmnichannel Evolution Supports Market Share Defensibility\n\nOver the past several years, Walmart has intensified its efforts to build a U.S. omnichannel model, and has seen commensurate improvement in its sales trajectory. The company has redirected capex toward technology and supply chain infrastructure to improve its customer-facing websites and establish a more flexible distribution network. The company recognizes that while stores are the anchor of the customer experience, a robust supply chain and seamless store/e-commerce experience are vital to maintaining market share within Walmart's ecosystem. Store investments include infrastructure to offer in-store pickup of online orders, which is an important offering particularly in grocery where in-home distribution is challenging. Walmart is also testing next-generation technology to position itself as a retail technology leader. For example, in April the company announced new voice-ordering capabilities for digital assistant devices. All of these enhances capabilities have benefited Walmart through the coronavirus pandemic and Fitch expects positive customer reception of Walmart's omnichannel offering positions the company well for longer-term share gains.\n\nThe company is using both its internal infrastructure and externally sourced capabilities and expertise to optimize its omnichannel efforts. For example, the company purchased Jet.com in 2016 to accelerate e-commerce functionality using Jet's inventory and pricing systems. The company's majority stake in India e-commerce leader Flipkart could provide insights that may benefit Walmart's global e-commerce platform.\n\nWalmart's operating strategy is supported by its ability to invest significant amounts of human capital and capex. Walmart's $10 billion capex run rate dwarfs most of its U.S. competitors aside from Amazon.com, Inc. ('A+'/Positive Outlook), which spent around $12 billion in capex in 2019, some of which was directed to its cloud computing division. In fact, Walmart's 2019 capex total compares to the combined approximately $12 billion capex run rate by four leading U.S. retailers: The Home Depot, Inc. ('A'/Stable), Target Corporation ('A-'/Stable), Costco Wholesale Corporation, and The Kroger Co.\n\nOperating Results Improving\n\nWalmart's omnichannel efforts have borne fruit with annual U.S. comparable store sales (comps) improving from an average of 1.0% during 2014-2016 to 2.1% in 2017, 3.6% in 2018, and 2.8% in 2019. The company noted a 37% increase in U.S. e-commerce revenue during 2019, supporting enterprise growth. With Walmart distancing itself from many smaller peers through investment ability and a good omnichannel strategy, Fitch expects U.S. comps can continue to grow around 2% over the next two to three years, with 5% growth anticipated in 2020.\n\nImproving topline results are supporting EBITDA stabilization following several years of EBITDA declines on increased growth investments and hourly wage increases. EBITDA, which peaked at $36 billion in 2014, declined from $32.2 billion in 2018 to $31.5 billion in 2019, at least partially as a result of a full year of Flipkart operating losses following its mid-2018 investment. Fitch expects 2020 EBITDA to decline to around $29.6 billion due to cost pressure related to the coronavirus pandemic, and merchandise mix shift away from higher-margin apparel and other discretionary categories. EBITDA could revert to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, and then grow around 2% annually, in line with revenue growth.\n\nInternational Portfolio Activity Supports Long-Term Sales Growth\n\nWalmart has recently adjusted its international focus to direct attention toward growth markets like China and India while harvesting other markets for cash; this provides Walmart long-term growth opportunities alongside near-term sources of investment. In 2018, for example, the company acquired a 77% stake in leading Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart for $16 billion and in 2017 formed a strategic alliance in 2017 with Chinese e-commerce player JD.com, Inc. in which it owns approximately 10%. These markets, and in particular e-commerce growth, should provide Walmart good sales growth opportunities over the long term, in addition to learnings which can be applied to larger markets. In the near term, however, Flipkart is expected to be a drag on operating profitability and cash flow for the next five or more years, generating an estimated EBITDA of negative $2 billion to negative $3 billion in 2019.\n\nWalmart's other large international markets are being positioned to either provide Walmart with stable cash flow generation or disposal opportunities. In 2018, the company sold an 80% interest in its Brazilian operations, which Fitch estimates contributed negligible EBITDA and cash flow, to private equity firm Advent International. The company also proposed a merger between its Asda operations in the U.K. with J Sainsbury plc, although this merger was cancelled due to regulatory concerns. Walmart has suggested an initial public offering is a possible alternate route for the business, which Fitch expects generates modestly (relative to the overall Walmart enterprise) positive EBITDA and cash flow.\n\nReasonable Leverage Supported by Strong FCF and Liquidity\n\nWalmart's credit profile is supported by reasonable adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x), which has historically trended around 2.0x. Walmart has maintained its leverage profile through occasional debt reduction, including during 2015-2017 as EBITDA declined. The company net issued approximately $12 billion of debt in 2018 to support its Flipkart investment, yielding adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 2.3x at year end. Fitch expects adjusted debt/EBITDAR could modestly rise to 2.4x in 2020 on EBITDA declines but moderate to the low-2.0x beginning 2022 on the resumption of EBITDA growth.\n\nWalmart's reasonable leverage profile is accompanied by strong FCF, with FCF after dividends averaging $11 billion the past four years. FCF in 2019 was somewhat below trend yet still ample at $7.9 billion, due to Flipkart operating losses, neutral working capital relative to benefits in prior years, and higher capex. Fitch expects FCF in 2020 to trend in the $7 billion range beginning 2020, assuming neutral working capital and capex growth to implement omnichannel and other initiatives. FCF could be used for a combination of share buybacks and debt reduction, given elevated debt balances following the debt-financed investment in Flipkart. Walmart's internally generated cash flow and external liquidity sources provide it great financial flexibility to invest in its business, maintain and grow market share, and manage through economic cycles."", 'derivation summary': ""Walmart's ratings reflect its dominant global retail market share position, with almost $524 billion of 2019 (ended January 2020) revenue, positive comparable store sales (comp) trend, substantial cash flow, and consistent financial strategy, which has resulted in stable leverage around 2x over time. Fitch projects organic annual revenue growth in the low-single-digit range with commensurate EBITDA growth beginning 2021 after a modest EBITDA decline in 2020 due to the impact of higher store-level expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic. FCF (after dividends) is forecast to range between $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion annually over the next several years. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which is expected to trend in the low-2.0x range over time, although could remain temporarily elevated at around 2.4x in 2020 due increased operating expenses related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLeading U.S. retailers within Fitch's coverage include Amazon.com ('A+'/Positive Outlook), The Home Depot, Inc. ('A'/Stable) and Target Corporation ('A-'/Stable). Together, these large players generate approximately just over $400 billion in annual revenue, well below Walmart's on a standalone basis.\n\nAmazon's rating is two notches lower than Walmart's despite similar leverage, its leading positions in e-commerce and cloud computing services, higher margins, and strong FCF generation due mainly to Walmart's larger scale and more consistent historical leverage profile. Home Depot's rating reflects its leading position in the home improvement industry, which benefits from limited online and discount incursion although is highly cyclical alongside housing market activity; Home Depot's adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to be approximately 2.0x. Target's ratings relative to Walmart consider its higher margins, historically similar leverage profile, smaller scale, and history of inconsistent comp performance, partially due to its higher price perception and exposure to discretionary categories that are both more cyclical and more exposed to online incursion.\n\nKey Assumptions\n\n--Revenue is expected to grow around 4.5% in 2020 as Walmart is able to capture additional sales in non-discretionary goods categories like groceries due to the coronavirus pandemic. Revenue growth is expected to turn modestly negative, down around 2% in 2021 as consumer spending patterns normalize. Beginning 2022, Fitch expects low-single digit growth in revenue, largely due to positive comps, including e-commerce growth.\n\n--EBITDA margins are expected to moderate from around 6% in 2019 to the mid 5% range in 2020 as the product mix shifts towards lower margin items like groceries, and as the company incurs additional costs due to the pandemic; EBITDA margins are expected to approach the 6.0% range beginning 2021 as consumer spending patterns normalize and pandemic-related expenses like employee bonuses abate.\n\n--EBITDA, which was $31.5 billion in 2019, could decline toward $29.6 billion in 2020 as the pandemic pressures operating margins. EBITDA is also negatively impacted by around $1.5 billion due to changes to Fitch's treatment of capital leases; the change has no impact on EBITDAR. In 2021, EBITDA is expected to rebound above $31 billion as merchandise mix and operating costs normalize; thereafter, EBITDA could grow modestly alongside topline expansion.\n\n--FCF, which was around $8 billion in 2019, could average around $7 billion beginning 2020. Fitch expects Walmart could direct FCF toward a combination of share repurchases and debt reduction.\n\n--Adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) historically trended around 2x but moved up to 2.3x in 2018 following the debt-financed investment in Flipkart, which generates operating losses. Fitch expects that leverage will rise modestly to around 2.4x 2020 due to EBITDA declines, but is expected to moderate to the low-2.0x beginning 2022 on modest EBITDA expansion and some cash flow deployment toward debt reduction."", 'rating sensitivities': ""Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\nAn upgrade is unlikely, given the rating is currently at the high end of the rating spectrum and fully captures the company's financial and qualitative strengths.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\nWeakening sales and EBITDA trajectory due to execution mis-steps or market share challenges from competitors;\n\n--Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (capitalizing leases at 8x) above the low 2.0x range on lower-than-expected operating results or debt-financed shareholder friendly activity.\n\nBest/Worst Case Rating Scenario\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

As of April 30, 2020, Walmart's revolver availability was reduced by $4.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding. Walmart's liquidity is further supported by meaningful FCF generation, expected to average in the $7 billion to $8 billion range annually.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2020, the total debt outstanding was $53.2 billion and upcoming maturities total $5.4 billion, $3.0 billion, and $2.8 billion, respectively, for calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Subsequent to the end of Walmart's 1Q 2020, approximately $2.8 billion of unsecured notes matured and Fitch expects Walmart paid these down with a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings.\n\nSummary of Financial Adjustments\n\n-Historical and projected EBITDA are adjusted for material one-time items as reported in financials\n\n-Fitch views operating leases as debt-like obligations, so capitalizes gross rent expense using a multiple of 8x.\n\nREFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING\n\nThe principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria."", 'esg considerations': ""The highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch\'s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch\'s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.\n\nThe information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
